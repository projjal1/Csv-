Arts Enterprises: Management & Structures,Arts Enterprises: Structures and Management examines the fundamental structures  governance  and management systems involved in running a successful 21st century arts enterprise. The course goes beyond a principles of arts management position to introduce students to the local  national  and international forces that make running an arts-based business unique. Students discover how arts enterprises are governed internally (formal leadership) and externally (public policy  market forces  and financial realities). Furthermore  students learn how enterprises engage multiple stakeholders  from artists or politicians to staff or audiences. Almost daily  arts managers are faced with choices that affect internal operation dynamics and external stakeholder relations. During the course  students will discern the day-to-day systems and operations of well-run arts organizations and investigate moments of failure in order to find the lessons learned. The course provides a lens into the nexus of institution-artist-audience within a framework of mission-impact and ROI. This course provides students with both the fundamentals and the emerging practices within arts enterprises creating a foundation for subsequent  advanced coursework. Students will encounter the theoretical frameworks necessary to understand the enterprise  and then ground the theory in real-life experience  case studies  and course-exercises. The course is organized in 4 modules: Public Policy and the Arts  Law and Structuring a Business  Running the Enterprise  and Issues in the Field. For the purpose of this course  arts enterprises will be defined as those that create relationships between artists and audiences. Arts enterprises include  but are not limited to: orchestras  opera companies  music ensembles  museums  arts centers  theatre companies  presenting organizations  multi-media centers  artist agencies  galleries  media and dance companies.,Governance,Public policy,Investigate,Operations,International

Producing a Performing Arts Season,The performing arts industry has had a varied lively history in the United States for the last 175 years (essentially once train travel allowed for broad distribution of artists across the nation). In the beginning the arts were for entertainment profit. Today  the need to entertain pay the bills persists  yet it is set within a (mostly) nonprofit landscape in which performing arts organizations produce works to transform audiences via one or several intersecting art forms. Producing a successful season entails selection (planning) implementation (managing) of programs  something that is neither easy nor consistent. Driving complicating the situation is the usual bifurcated management structure. Managers must find a way to implement the vision an Artistic Director - an individual with an aesthetic framework that shapes an institution its artistic offerings. Arts managers enable his or her artistic vision within the context of the physical  geographical financial situation of a company. Combining mixing these forces is frequently messy always an adventure. Organizational history provides some structures to the process  but each season brings new artistic managerial challenges against a backdrop of a rapidly changing society. If a career of doing the same thing is the goal then a different field might be recommended. This course will examine approaches to producing a performing arts season of programming with an emphasis on the nonprofit season structure. Over 7 short weeks we will attempt to answer the following question: How do managers move an organization mission through an artistic vision set across a selection of programs create a system to manage the process evaluate artistic success  community impact mission-centric strategic goals? How can arts leaders commission new works in an environment that provides greater earned income for doing things people already know?,Travel,Process,System,Programming,Distribution

Critical Theory in Art III,The Duchampian attack on traditional aesthetic categories has been the engine behind the distinctive shifts in postwar art. Photography  performance  conceptual proposals  installation art  film  video  and appropriations from mass culture play an equal part in contemporary visual culture. Duchamps attack on art as an institution set the tone for other anti-modernist projects to follow which did not accept the white cube of the gallery as their sole exhibition space (or measured worth as an artist). His notions of indifference  (critique of aesthetic judgment)  reproducibility  simulation  performativity  artist-as-curator  and interactivity between the spectator and the work of art set the stage for a host of innovative explorations by artists ranging from the Combines of Robert Rauschenberg to the Mod-Spaceships of Mariko Mori. This seminar examines a tumultuous period in contemporary art and culture from 1960 to the mid-eighties  with special excursions into the aesthetics of commodification  phenomenology  materialism  conceptualism  semiotics  abjection  and technology. The impact of social movements and American foreign policies (i.e. Vietnam  Civil Rights  The Womens Movement  Globalism  the Aids Crisis) on the production and reception of contemporary art will also be examined. Open to sophomores in the School of Art  or by instructor permission.,Policies,Visual,Installation,Video,Photography

Advanced SIS: Special Topic:,Hito Steyerl asked  Is the internet dead? ...[it is] completely surveilled  monopolized  and sanitized by common sense  copyright  control  and conformism... what happened to the internet after it stopped being a possibility? This course assumes it is the artists role to find and create possibilities in all contexts  and investigates what it means to create new possibilities by making physical objects  experiences  sculptures  installations  and systems in an era post-internet. As a project-based experimental lab  this class asks students to navigate back and forth between digital and physical creative tool sets to create new works. We will take inspiration from the history  theory  ideologies and technologies surrounding the internet  as well as from artists  animators  and engineers working on and around the internet today. We will explore issues surrounding automation  digital fabrication  and online maker / fabricator culture as tools to be used  but also as socio-political forces. Other concepts we will explore as a group include the relationship between body and technology; cybernetics  robotics  AI  and the uncanny valley; the relevancy of hand-making and physical construction post-automation; image-objects; scripted spaces; the producer-consumer continuum; the divisiveness and productiveness of online subcultures; anonymity; accessibility of information and production tools; and the spatial and temporal effects of inhabiting both digital and physical worlds. If we understand our current epoch as an era dominated by onscreen and networked experiences  this course investigates what it means to embrace  explore  explode  celebrate  negate  critique  reverse  or oppose that through the making of sculpture  broadly defined. This course assumes knowledge of at least very basic 3d modeling  and/or physical computing  and/or coding  and/or 3d media fabrication/construction techniques.,Construction,Coding,Experimental,Ai,Modeling,Fabrication,Automation

Managing Effective Work Teams,Over the past decade  managers have greatly expanded their use of teams to accomplish a wide variety of organizational objectives. Teams have emerged as a favorite work arrangement for such ongoing activities as developing new products  providing professional services  and starting new businesses. Temporary groups are frequently assembled for a multitude of purposes  such as making difficult decisions  solving cross-functional problems  generating ideas  or performing unique tasks. Indeed  groups and teams can be found at every level of the organization  from production crews on the shop floor to top management teams in the executive suite. Moreover  advances in communication technology have created the potential for people who are dispersed across the globe to collaborate virtually  creating many new opportunities and challenges for leaders of such teams. Teams are not a panacea  however. Even as they become a way of life in many organizations  widespread myths and misconceptions about teams often stand in the way of effective teamwork. At their worst  teams sometimes create more problems than they solve. The core content of the course is a series of team and group exercises  case analyses  and readings. The exercises are framed and analyzed in terms of readings  lecture  and in-depth class discussions. Much of the learning that occurs in the course will involve exercises  simulations  and cases that draw on students current experiences in the class as well as their previous experiences in teams and organizations outside of this class.,Communication,Content

Students will research and present findings on the characteristics of specific cultures. They will prepare business documents and presentations that build on the knowledge and skills acquired in 70-340  Business Communication  and reflect new sensitivities to the needs of specific cross-cultural audiences. This course is offered only at the Carnegie Mellon-Qatar campus.,Research,Presentations,Communication
Financial Regulation in the Digital Age,The financial crisis has focused attention on the role of regulation for our financial system and the broader economy. The course will address the foundations of regulation (why regulate?) from various perspectives within the context of a market economy  highlighting the sources of market failure (such as externalities  adverse selection  and natural monopoly) and potential remedies (such as taxes and fees  disclosure  price regulation  guarantees). The conflicting goals among regulators (and why we have multiple regulators) and their impact on the meaning of regulation will be considered along with regulatory competition/arbitrage. Portions of the course will tackle relatively broad questions such as: Why regulate? What is the law of unintended consequences? What is the objective of a policy advocate? Are regulators and regulatory policies a systemic risk? Are our markets rigged? How can regulators enhance the predictability and credibility of their policies? How costly were government guarantees during the financial crisis? Should we bar insider trading? Should regulations be determined and motivated based upon cost-benefit analysis? How can we evaluate the success or failure of particular regulations and whether they have achieved their objectives? How does the Dodd-Frank Act promote financial stability? What basic aspects of the financial crisis did Dodd-Frank not address? (Lecture  3 hours). Minimum grade standard of C applies only to economics courses.,Analysis,Policies,System,C,Regulations,Economics,Regulatory

Finance,Firms create value by making good investment decisions. Finance is the field of management science tasked with making this happen. It is a set of tools with which firms identify good investments and decide how to pay for them. Paying for them ultimately involves getting money from households. Therefore  finance also describes the investment decisions of households and the resulting allocation of the economys resources across firms and time. This course is the introductory finance course in the undergraduate business program. The main topics covered in the course are Financial Markets  Net Present Value  The Objective of the Firm  Discounted Cash Flow  Portfolio Theory and the Cost of Capital  The Efficient Markets Hypothesis  The Capital Structure of the Firm  and Business Valuation. Time permitting  the course will also provide an introduction to option markets and derivative securities. Upon completing the course a student will be able to consider a large and complex business problem  make some assumptions  structure the firms cash flows in a spreadsheet  calculate the value of different solutions to the problem  and make a decision.,Finance,Money,Hypothesis
Funding Entrepreneurial Ventures,So you want to do a startup and you know that you need funding. There are multiple ways to fund a new venture: bootstrapping  economic development  angels  venture capitalists. The question is what are these funders looking for in an early stage investment? What is important to them? How do they decide which companies to invest in and which not? This class looks at funding from the funders point of view and provides the student with a framework of the investment process: investment criteria  sourcing  selection  due diligence  deal structure  valuation  post investment involvement. Real companies seeking funding are used for the final project in which students will be expected  as investment teams  to make investment decisions and convince their fellow investors (the class) to join them (or not). This is a highly interactive and project class. There will be multiple guest speakers.,Sourcing,Process,Interactive,Startup,Due diligence

Biology for Life Special Topics Mini
: The Evolutionary Biology of Sex,Special Topics in Biological Sciences Mini Courses. Topics will vary depending on the semester and instructor. Courses offered under this course number will not require prior knowledge of or exposure to biological sciences and are open to students from any major and class year. Please read individual section descriptions for more information. Fall 2020: Section A1: The Evolutionary Biology of Sex. Section A2: Germs: The Good  The Bad  and The Ugly. Bacteria are a scourge to humankind  causing life-threatening infections like tuberculosis  meningitis  and pneumonia to the less severe ear infections and strep throats that plague many childhoods. On the other hand  the healthy human microbiota is a community of microorganisms dominated by trillions of bacteria that reside everywhere from our skin to nasal passages and gut. This virtual organ is estimated to weigh as much as the human brain and contributes to essential bodily functions like food metabolism and defense against infection  while also impacting memory  anxiety  and depression. Changes in the gut microbiota are also associated with diseases including autism  obesity  allergies  and inflammatory bowel disease. Why the incidence of these chronic diseases is increasing is unclear  but it may be the result of excessive antibiotic use  dietary changes that harm our gut microbes  or both. This century will be marked by both the challenge of antibiotic resistant infectious bad bacteria  and the possibilities to harness good bacteria to promote human health. In this course  we explore how bacteria make you healthy and what we can do to nurture our microbiota  and how bacteria make you sick and what we can do to stop them.

Introduction to Biophysics,This intermediate level course is primarily offered to Physics and Biology undergrads (junior/senior) and provides a modern view of molecular and cellular biology as seen from the perspective of physics  and quantified through the analytical tools of physics. This course will not review experimental biophysical techniques (which are covered  e.g.  in 03-871). Rather  physicists will learn what sets bio apart from the remainder of the physics world and how the apparent dilemma that the existence of life represents to classical thermodynamics is reconciled. They also will learn the nomenclature used in molecular biology. In turn  biologists will obtain (a glimpse of) what quantitative tools can achieve beyond the mere collecting and archiving of facts in a universe of observations: By devising models  non-obvious quantitative predictions are derived which can be experimentally tested and may lead to threads that connect vastly different  apparently unrelated phenomena. One major goal is then to merge the two areas  physics and biology  in a unified perspective.,Analytical,Physics,Biology,Experimental

Generative Systems for Design,Rather than working directly with analogue media  such as drawings  designers can develop algorithms and computational models that can automatically generate design alternatives  based on custom inputs. We refer to such algorithms and models as Generative Systems (GS). GS have been an important topic of research in the recent past decades  in books  courses  articles and research conferences in computer-aided architectural design. While earlier approaches were based on classical artificial intelligence and optimization  recently  a variety of computational techniques from different fields  such as parametric modeling  agent-based modeling or neural networks  are incorporated in the development of new generative systems. With recent developments in machine learning  we are reaching a point where we might not even have to explicit specify a new generative schema  but  instead  let it learn automatically from data or experience. Contemporary design education must be reviewed with the possibility of relying on autonomous or collaborative design systems for the synthesis of alternatives. Designers should be able to formulate their design with different computational techniques  both with the GS available on commercial applications and with custom developed GS. The main goal of the course is to foster the students capacity to formulate design problems computationally  with emphasis on the synthesis of design alternatives. This course provides an overview of the main topics in GS  with historical notes and technical specifications. Along the semester  the students will address different design problems with different generative techniques. The course will address topics such as variational modeling  rule-based modeling  agent-based modeling  optimization and learning.

NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer Science course.,Process,C,Programming,Algorithms
Principles of Functional Programming,An introduction to programming based on a functional model of computation. The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is  as a function. But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions  the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types  including not only aggregates built up from other types  but also functions themselves as values. This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type. One major theme is the interplay between inductive types  which are built up incrementally; recursive functions  which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction  which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function. Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules  and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

Please see the course webpage for a detailed list of topics.,Security,Cryptography
Operating System Practicum,The goal of this class is for students to acquire hands-on experience with operating-system code as it is developed and deployed in the real world. Groups of two to four students will select  build  install  and become familiar with an open-source operating system project; propose a significant extension or upgrade to that project; and develop a production-quality implementation meeting the coding standards of that project. Unless infeasible  the results will be submitted to the project for inclusion in the code base. Variations on this theme are possible at the discretion of the instructor. For example  it may be possible to work within the context of a non-operating-system software infrastructure project (window system  web server  or embedded network device kernel) or to extend a 15-410 student kernel. In some situations students may work alone. Group membership and unit count (9 units versus 12) will be decided by the third week of the semester. Contributing to a real-world project will involve engaging in some mixture of messy  potentially open-ended activities such as: learning a revision control system  writing a short design document  creating and updating a simple project plan  participating in an informal code review  synthesizing scattered information about hardware and software  classifying and/or reading large amounts of code written by various people over a long period of time  etc.,Hardware,System,Writing,Coding,Design,Plan

Undergraduate Complexity Theory,Complexity theory is the study of how much of a resource (such as time  space  parallelism  or randomness) is required to perform some of the computations that interest us the most. In a standard algorithms course  one concentrates on giving resource efficient methods to solve interesting problems. In this course  we concentrate on techniques that prove or suggest that there are no efficient methods to solve many important problems. We will develop the theory of various complexity classes  such as P  NP  co-NP  PH  P  PSPACE  NC  AC  L  NL  UP  RP  BPP  IP  and PCP. We will study techniques to classify problems according to our available taxonomy. By developing a subtle pattern of reductions between classes we will suggest an (as yet unproven) picture of how by using limited amounts of various resources  we limit our computational power.,P,Pattern,Algorithms

Operating System Design and Implementation,Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems. The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel  in C with some x86 assembly language  which runs on a PC hardware simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish). Work is done in two-person teams  and team programming skills (source control  modularity  documentation) are emphasized. The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design  implementation  and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model  virtual memory  threads  synchronization  and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems  interprocess communication  networking  and security. Students  especially graduate students  who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C  use a debugger  understand 2s-complement arithmetic  and translate between C and x86 assembly language. The instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class. Auditing: this course is usually full  and we generally receive many more requests to audit than we can accept. If you wish to audit  please have your advisor contact us before the semester begins to discuss your educational goals.,Communication,Assembly,Unix,Writing,Audit,Hardware,Process,System,C,Networking,Auditing,Debugging,Requests,Programming,Operating systems,Documentation,Security,Os,Design

Logical Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems,Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) combine cyber capabilities (computation and/or communication) with physical capabilities (motion or other physical processes). Cars  aircraft  and robots are prime examples  because they move physically in space in a way that is determined by discrete computerized control algorithms. Designing these algorithms to control CPSs is challenging due to their tight coupling with physical behavior. At the same time  it is vital that these algorithms be correct  since we rely on CPSs for safety-critical tasks like keeping aircraft from colliding. This course pursues the fundamental question: How can we provide people with cyber-physical systems they can bet their lives on?,Safety,Communication,Algorithms

Advanced Topics in PL: Foundations of Quantitative Program Analysis
: Foundations of Quantitative Program Analysis,SECTION AA: Foundations of Quantitative Program Analysis Resource usage---the amount of time  memory  and energy a program requires for its execution---is one of the central subjects of computer science. Nevertheless  resource usage often does not play a central role in classical programming-language concepts such as operational semantics  type systems  and program logics. This course revisits these concepts to model and analyze resource usage of programs in a formal and compositional way. The emphasis is on practical  type-based techniques that automatically inform programmers about the resource usage of their code. We also discuss applications of the techniques  in particular in programming languages for digital contracts. The second part of the course studies probabilistic programming languages. Such languages describe probability distributions and can be used to precisely describe and analyze probabilistic models. The focus of the course is on semantics and analysis of probabilistic language but we also discuss applications of probabilistic programming.

MDES Seminar III: Advanced Interaction & Service Design Concepts,This seminar is an exploration of the leading edge of current interaction design practice. Most of these new developments reflect the conflicting ways in which the work of interaction designers is expanding in scope whilst also speeding up. This necessitates that designers understand more non-design domains of knowledge  for instance  in relation to domains of cultural difference  organizational change  business strategy  risk management. It also demands that designers pay more attention to processes and organizations - their own as professional designers  but also those of their clients and stakeholders. And it requires that interaction designers have a better understanding of their profession within wider socio- economic transformations. The course will involve a range of readings with participants required to develop public positions on emerging design practice trends. To this end  the course will teach multi-modal social media communication techniques. It will also involve developing research-based strategies for helping complex organizations in transition.,Communication,Risk management,Strategy,Business strategy,Research,Design

This course requires significant additional scheduled time on evenings and weekends for crew calls  which are an important element of the course.,Safety,Technical,Training,Operations,Process,Content
Production Science,Students in the Production Science course are exposed to the very fundamentals  the primitives  of entertainment technology. The intent is to provide the absolutely strongest beginning for all the work to come  to provide a solid foundation for students and instructors to build upon. Production professionals routinely perform organizational tasks. In order to be able to meet that challenge  students will need to build a toolkit of information and procedures. That toolkit will be comprised of knowledge of the kinds of parameters and techniques that are normally selected  the indices that parameters and techniques are evaluated against  and many of the wide range of issues that might point a manager toward one decision or another. There also exists an entire pantheon of information that people typically learn on the job. Activities and information presented in this course are designed to try to expose students to as much of this on the job type development as possible with the goal of leapfrogging them past the bottom rung of the workplace ladder.

Machine Learning for Signal Processing,Signal Processing is the science that deals with extraction of information from signals of various kinds. This has two distinct aspects -- characterization and categorization. Traditionally  signal characterization has been performed with mathematically-driven transforms  while categorization and classification are achieved using statistical tools. Machine learning aims to design algorithms that learn about the state of the world directly from data. A increasingly popular trend has been to develop and apply machine learning techniques to both aspects of signal processing  often blurring the distinction between the two. This course discusses the use of machine learning techniques to process signals. We cover a variety of topics  from data driven approaches for characterization of signals such as audio including speech  images and video  and machine learning methods for a variety of speech and image processing problems.

Reading and Writing in an Academic Context,76-100 is an academic reading and writing course for multilingual students  especially those who are not native speakers of English or who consider English to be their weaker language. The course emphasizes reading comprehension strategies for reading a variety of text types in English (e.g.  journalism  textbook selections  popular press arguments  and academic journal articles). Throughout the semester  students use these sources to write summaries and short position papers. The course introduces students to readers expectations for North American rhetorical style at the sentence  paragraph  and whole text or genre levels. Within the course we discuss explicit genre and linguistic norms for writing in academic English so that writers can connect with their readers. Students who take this course qualify through an online placement test that is administered through the university prior to the fall semester. (All sections are offered MWF). Each 76-100 course is structured by the reading and writing objectives of the course as well as a vocabulary for writing in English  but some courses present different themes (or content) in their readings.,Journalism,English,Writing,Content
Interpretation and Argument,Interpretation and Argument is a foundational  inquiry-driven writing course that introduces students to a variety of strategies for making compositional decisions in writing and communication. Within the course  students learn genre-based skills applicable to a variety of different fields. Students use a comparative genre analysis method to learn how to use models to take on new writing tasks  including an academic research proposal and a research article that contributes to an ongoing academic conversation. Faculty who teach 76-101 typically select texts  ranging from scholarly texts  journalism  and film  about an issue so that students can identify interesting questions for their own research projects. Students should expect explicit  research-based instruction  practice  and reflection to build knowledge in controlling their writing processes and writing clear  well-supported  reader-oriented arguments. Because the course emphasizes the real stakes of communicating with readers and listeners  students share with their peers both low and high stakes written work within an interactive and collaborative classroom environment. Due to the limits of our schedule  we are unable to meet each students individual preferences for course topics  but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

Writing about Literature  Art and Culture,This mini course (one of two minis students can choose to fulfill their FYW requirement) uses artistic  literary  and cultural texts (e.g.  poetry  short story  lyrics  video clips) to introduce students to a variety of academic reading and writing practices that enable students to engage with texts and write about them with complexity and nuance. Within the course  we will discuss texts and evidence from multiple perspectives. We will examine how literary and cultural scholars write about texts (defined broadly)  how they make claims  provide reasoning  and use textual support to argue for particular ways of seeing cultural objects. Throughout the semester  students will draw upon prior strategies and develop new ones for close reading and for critical analysis in order to produce their own thesis-driven arguments about why texts matter. We will consider and write about the extent to which these reading strategies are relevant for other kinds of reading and analysis by comparing texts from a variety of different disciplinary contexts.,Analysis,Video,Writing
Writing about Public Problems,If all problems required a simple fix  we could don our Avenger costumes  pick up Thors hammer  and right the worlds wrongs. But most problems arent so simple. Most of the problems we encounter require careful investigation and research so that we might propose solutions that connect with others to make change. In this 76101 class (one of two minis students can choose to fulfill their FYW requirement)  we will learn how public problems are defined and argued across a range of texts  including proposals  op-ed genres  and white papers. By analyzing a range of proposal texts  we will identify the different kinds of legwork necessary to write a successful proposal  arguably one of the most challenging aspects of writing a persuasive recommendation for change. We will examine how writers unpack problems rhetorically and use evidence to argue solutions for different stakeholders who may not share common values. We will learn strategies for evaluating and synthesizing data from existing research to use in a proposal argument. By the end of the course  students will write their own proposal that recommends a solution and a feasible plan for solving a real problem.,Proposal,Investigation,Writing,Research,Plan

The period between 1660 and 1830 saw an explosion of newspapers and visual media  and theaters expanded from seating a few hundred to pleasure palaces accommodating thousands. New media forms  like the modern novel and musical theater  were gobbled up by audiences hungry for innovation. It was an age of experiment in gender and sexuality as well as media  an age in which cross-dressing flourished  and modern ideas of sexual conformityand transgressioncame into being. Race entered European consciousness through the distorting lens of the African slave trade and the growth of consumer desire for merchandise from continents to the east and west of the British Empire. This course will give you the contexts for understanding the impact of media on our lives today. In addition  you will gain skills in critical reading and writing that are applicable to a range of media  such as visual prints  plays  as well as literary texts.,Visual,Word,English,Writing
Literature & Culture of the 20th and 21st Century,Topics vary by semester. Fall 2020: Contemporary American Fiction No one seems to know quite how to define contemporary American fiction. Its clear that fiction has changed since the 1960s and 70s  the heyday of postmodernism  but its not clear what exactly characterizes the work that has come since. In this course  we will read a selection of American fiction from the 1980s to the present and try to get a sense of its main lines. In particular well look at the turn to genre  the expansion to multicultural authors  and the return to realism. Also  we will consider how it relates to American society.

Survey of Forms: Creative Nonfiction,In this course we will analyze the different types of narrative structure  narrative suspense  voice  metaphor  and point of view that make for effective nonfiction writing. We will also examine the difference between good writers and good work  the functions of objective distance from and intimate investment in a subject  as well as the philosophical questions spurred by nonfiction writing. What is the nonfiction writers role  and how does it differ from that of the fiction writer? Where do the two genres overlap? What gives nonfiction writing integrity? What does the term creative nonfiction mean? How have the form and aims of nonfiction writing - from memoir to essays to long-form journalism - evolved for better and for worse?,Analyze,Journalism,Writing
Survey of Forms: Screenwriting,This is a course in screenplay narrative. The screenplay has a certain format observed by every screenwriter. It is not so difficult to learn the format. The difficulty is in developing a screen story populated by believable characters  creating an expressive and logical relationship between the scenes by manipulating screen space and screen time  knowing what to omit from the story and what to emphasize  and finally writing dialogue that sounds real  but that does not simply copy everyday speech. The class will be structured into weekly writing exercises  discussion of the narratives under consideration  presentation and discussion of student work  and a final writing project.,Presentation,Writing
Writing for the Professions,Writing in the Professions is a writing course specifically designed for juniors and seniors in all majors other than English. The course is appropriate for upper-level students in all CMU colleges  has no writing prerequisites  and assumes that you may not have had much college-level writing instruction past your freshman year. The basic idea of the course is to give you experience in developing the writing skills you will be expected to have as you make the transition from student to professional. The course will cover resume writing  proposal writing  writing instructions  the difference between writing for general and specific audiences  and analysis of visual aids in various texts. The course requires that students work both independently and in groups.,Analysis,Proposal,Visual,English,Writing
Critical Writing Workshop,The goal of this course is to sharpen your ability to read and write about literary and other imaginative works. Critical reading and writing mean gathering and evaluating language and images to form an interpretation of a print  visual  or other media text. To that end  you will learn analytical keywords and terms from literary and cultural theory and how to apply them to texts and other objects. The focus will be on theories of race and gender and how they inform literary texts and our reading of them. Our courses method for critical writing instruction will be to workshop drafts of your essays. To that end  you will write four short to mid-length interpretive papers in the course. You will also gain practice at oral presentation and critique. To help us fine tune and integrate our critical skills we will spend the semester writing and thinking though genre  the categories by which we name and understand literature  and other media. Since this is a writing workshop and our time for reading will be somewhat limited  we are focusing on gothic literature  as the genre developed from the 18th to the 20th century. The communication and analytic skills you acquire in this class will transfer to your work in a wide range of academic disciplines and professional contexts.,Presentation,Communication,Analytical,Visual,Writing
Disability in Pop Culture,In 2016  ABC debuted the show Speechless  which follows the life of JJ  a high school teenager with cerebral palsy. In 2015  Deaf West Theatre premiered a revival production of Spring Awakening on Broadway by a cast of both deaf and hearing actors who performed the show using American Sign Language and English simultaneously. In 2013  Allie Brosh released a book version of her blog titled Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations  Flawed Coping Mechanisms  Mayhem  and Other Things That Happeneda combination of webcomics and stories that includes discussions of depression. These examples are a mere few of more recent representations of disability in pop culture and society. In this course  we will address how representations of disability tell stories about difference. Using the tools of rhetorical analysis  we will ask the following questions: How do memoirs  films  comics  health initiatives  policies  advertisements  laws  and poetry use language and images to influence or construct our understandings of disability? How do these representations engage differences of gender  race  class  and sexuality? And finally  how does this work expand broader cultural  aesthetic  and political views of embodiment  disability  and difference? Students in this course will 1) develop a vocabulary for talking about disability and difference using concepts such as normal  embodiment  the gaze  passing  and access; 2) examine how disability interacts with and shapes our public  professional  and academic worlds; and 3) practice analyzing rhetorical elements such as purpose  genre  audience  context  form  and style. Student projects will include two shorter papers and one major project.,Analysis,Policies,Health,English,Access

Leadership  Dialogue  and Change,This course is about an alternative to the great man theory of leadership--in which success is built on charisma  power  status  or institutional authority. The alternative model of adaptive leadership  however  depends on an ability to draw a divided community into a dialogue that re-frames the problem and may even call on us to re-interpret our values. We will see this in action  comparing the methods of Martin Luther King to the radical community organizing of Saul Alinsky  or in the influential of African-American cultural critiques of Cornel West and bell hooks  or in the work of students calling for change on campuses. Their work poses a question: how does dialogue work in the rhetoric of making a difference? So in the second half  we will put theory into practice  organizing a CMU Community Think Tank to explore this question: how do college students take effective leadership on public issues raised on campus ( e.g.  climate change  equity for workers  or the corporate ethics of would-be employers)? How do student advocates give rhetorical presence to problems or create counterpublics that actually put ideas into circulation? How do departments and faculty support publicly engaged learning in their disciplines? In this project of studying and taking leadership  you will develop skills in framing a shared problem  collecting data across diverse  often competing perspectives  in creating a Briefing Book to guide live Round Table problem-solving dialogues  and in documenting  writing and publishing your Findings on www.cmu.edu/thinktank. As a portfolio project  it will also demonstrate your ability to support problem-solving dialogues across difference in a community or organization.,Publishing,Writing

A/B Testing  Design  and Analysis,This course looks at how to use A/B testing to measure causal effects in online platforms in the era of big data analytics. We aim at answering questions such as how does the demand for a product change when the price does or the ratings do? How can we anticipate how sales and profits change if the firm changes its business strategy? Facebook  Google  Amazon and similar firms ask and answer questions of this kind everyday using their large online platforms. This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild and in network settings. The concepts and tools discussed in this course are general in nature and can be applied in settings other than online platforms such as energy  transportation and education. The examples in class will be mostly drawn from our own work at the Heinz College on the media industry. Lectures are 3 hours long. In the first half of each lecture we go over concepts behind A/B tests and what to do when A/B tests are unavailable. The discussion is based on the ideas and intuition behind these concepts. In the second half of each lecture we go over specific examples -- we study the associated datasets and the code used to analyze them properly. Student evaluation is based on five weekly homeworks and a brief term project to be developed in teams.

Geographic Information Systems,Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are information systems specifically designed to store and analyze geographic data. GIS represents almost all elements on the earth  such as roadways  rivers  utilities  cities  mountains  natural resources  energy infrastructure and so forth. GIS is used to visualize  analyze and compute the data about the world and human activities. What makes GIS different from other IS is that the data is stored and visualized on a map. The spatial analysis on the map reveals unique patterns in the geographic scope  which is the main advantage over table or text based data representation.,Analysis,Gis,Analyze
Consulting Lab,Communication is the glue that holds consulting engagements  teams  and relationships together. Arguably  the better a consultant you are  the better a communicator you are  and the best communicators tend to make very good consultants (nice symmetry there). Poor communication and other soft skills can derail a consulting engagement and with it  a promising consulting career. As an example  a Gartner Group study found that 80 of all IT projects were late  over budget  or failed completely because of poor communication at the outset. This course will help students interested in a consulting career acquire new skills in everything from personal branding to asking high-value  incisive questions to building strong  long-term client relationships,Communication,Consulting,Budget,Engagement,Branding
Project Management,As organizations continue to look for ways to reduce costs  managers are often expected to oversee special projects in addition to their traditional responsibilities.

Over the course of the mini  students will complete a plan for an actual project  giving them valuable experience with the relevant tools and skills  including Microsoft Project software.,Schedule,Budget,Plan
Evidence-Based Management,Contemporary managers are heavily swayed in their thinking and decisions by habit fads convention and unrealistic levels of confidence (March 2010; Pfeffer Sutton 2006). Managers practicing EBMgt learn how to rethink their approaches to data and knowledge in order to make more effective decisions. EBMgt means making decisions based on best obtainable evidence that is scientific findings and unbiased organizational facts. These decisions rely on decision processes that reduce bias and judgment errors and give due consideration to ethical concerns. This mini course promotes your understanding and use of EBMgt principles. It also guides you in developing the skills and knowledge needed to identify access and use quality evidence from science and practice in making better decisions. The instructor is committed to pursuing an evidence-based approach to the course itself. Scientific evidence strongly supports the effectiveness of active student participation in learning activities (Ambrose et al. 2010; Armstrong 2010; Tough 1971). Your success in this course will entail actively using evidence-based processes and practices.

Design Thinking for Complex Systems,In the current century  as the distinctions between nature  culture  and the artificial become increasingly blurry  we can no longer talk about interventions within social or economic domains without thinking through them in shape and form of complex socio-technical systems  models of aspects of the world that can guide intentional change. Thinking of designed technologies in relation to different models and ways of seeing and thinking about the word we live in is crucial for practitioners involved in any kind of change through technological interventions  whether at the level of technology production  or deployment  or policy. This mini course introduces students to designerly approaches using systems theory. It aims to sensitize them to a range of different ways to frame and think about systems and expose them to a range of specific systems thinking techniques and terminologies for analyzing complex natural  socio-cultural and technological phenomena and making evaluable changes to those phenomena. As a result  by the end of the course students will expect to have developed a better sense of where and how to effective interventions and gauge the effects and impacts of those interventions.,Word,Technical
Applied Analytics: ML Pipeline,Machine learning is a highly valued set of analytics techniques  a confluence of ideas from computer science  statistics  economics  physics  and others. Machine learning is transforming fields with new capabilities  ways of understanding and visualizing data  and is becoming a key driver in decision making. However  knowing when (and how) to apply appropriate machine learning techniques requires understanding of data  machine learning  and the problem domain. This class seeks to teach students how to address the entire machine learning pipeline  starting from messy data and provisional questions and ending with actionable interpretations and insights. The course will cover discovery  planning  analysis  and interpretation. Discovery involves understanding the data at hand  determining what is and is not answerable  and question generation. Planning involves contrasting the application of the desired machine learning method on ideal clean data with the messy data at hand. Dealing with representation  missing data  and designing appropriate machine learning machinery are all involved in planning. Analysis involves applying the machine learning method  checking model performance and assumptions in a principled and responsible manner. Interpretation involves the transformation of algorthm outputs into meaningful and actionable characterizations of the results. Each part of the pipeline is interconnected and students will learn to anticipate and address limitations through understanding of the pipeline as a whole. Throughout the course we will focus on one vertical  health care  recognizing that the methods developed will generalize to others. We will work with real  messy  structured and unstructed data--including databases  text  and images. We will contrast machine learning methods against what is currently used in health care analytics  and describe the advantages and promise of each.,Analysis,Statistics,Analytics,Machine learning,Computer science,Health,Physics,Economics

Guiding questions will be: How did the countrys economy  society  and politics structure the development of popular culture? How did performers and entrepreneurs develop industries around new innovations in popular culture? And how did popular culture shape the countrys economy  society  and politics?,Sports,Social media
Body Politics: Women and Health in America,[Note: Students who have taken 66-121  First Year Seminar: Body Politics: Women and Health in America  may not enroll.] This course takes a topical  intersectional approach to the history of U.S. womens health in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is less about governmental politics  although we do some of that. Rather  it sees bodies as cultural texts through which power is built and contested. The course covers topics such as the history of anatomy  menstruation  reproductive rights  body image  mental health  sexuality  violence  childbirth  and menopause. We explore how science and American culture both have constructed these issues over time (some of it is super whacky)  while also examining womens organizing around them. This course is open to all students.,Health
General Francisco Franco: Fascism and its Legacies in Spain,Francisco Franco was Europes longest-ruling dictator. He ruled over Spain from 1939 to 1975. This course will examine the social and cultural context of the rise of Fascism in Spain. We will focus especially on the colonial legacy of Spanish fascism; The fall of the democratic II Spanish Republic and Francos seizure of power during the bloody Spanish Civil War; the decades of his lengthy dictatorship; the social and cultural politics in transitioning Spain to democracy after his death; and the legacy of Spanish Fascism and Francos dictatorship in contemporary Spain. In addition to class lectures  students will become familiar with these themes through the reading and discussion of historical texts  current political and cultural debates  music and film.,Spanish

A number of the environmental and public health cases considered will focus on Pittsburgh.,Health
Theory and Method in Historical Studies,This seminar will introduce first-year graduate students to a few key historical concepts that have informed historical thinking and writing as it is practiced today. We will focus on some classic works of social theory to analyze how their authors had sought to identify and interrogate themes such as: the nature of modernity; the relationship between social and economic change and class; the relationship between politics and culture; the role of gender in the articulation of power relationships; the relationship between European nations and their colonies abroad  and the significance of this colonial past for the post-colonial world. We will also read recent scholarship to identify why contemporary historians found those theories both inspirational and insufficient  and how they challenged their theoretical precursors via alternative ways of seeing and methods of historical interpretation.,Analyze,Writing
DC Grand Challenge First-Year Seminar: Democracy & Data,From gerrymandering to online political ads  data is being used in ways that raise urgent questions about the integrity of democratic elections. But the relationship between democracy and data goes far beyond elections. In a world of constant surveillance  in which vast amounts of data are gathered from our phones  our computers  and from other facets of our lives - and in which new breakthroughs in machine learning and data analytics make such data dramatically more powerful - what does it mean for average citizens to have control over their own lives? What does democracy mean?,Analytics
DC Grand Challenge First-Year Seminar: How We Vote,This course investigates the sacred American practice of voting  the cornerstone of American democracy  using the 2020 election cycle as our laboratory. The course uses a multi-disciplinary approach  examining the topic from several different perspectives. Well investigate social movements to expand the vote  the role of technology  game theory  polling  predictions  electoral mapping  social media  the structures of American governance  and more. Questions include: What is the electoral college? Who gets to vote and why? How well is that vote accounted for? How can voting systems be compromised? Why is it so hard to predict who will win? How do people make decisions? How useful are polling predictions? What disrupts voting? Why is turnout so low? How does money play a role in the election cycle? Why do we vote the way we do? How is social media changing elections? What are global best practices? Did the founders even intend for a mass democracy? (The answer is no) Many of you will be first-time  eligible voters in one of the most remarkable presidential campaigns in American history. Well build your skills as new democratic citizens  of this nation or others  and help you make sense of the history-making U.S. news cycle. A note on partisanship: All political viewpoints are welcome in this class. This is a course on how we navigate and account for political difference in a diverse  disparate nation. This is something well practice in class  while we will also study that very process across the nation.,Money,Governance,Investigate,Process,Social media
DC Grand Challenge First-Year Seminar: Artificial Intelligence and Humanity,In 1965 British mathematician I.J. Good wrote  An ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an intelligence explosion  and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. As we enter an age where companies like Uber are testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh and innovative interfaces like IBMs Watson can play Jeopardy and learn techniques for medical diagnoses  how are we to negotiate an intelligence explosion that for many individuals might threaten the very notions of what it means to be human? The future of human-to-machine relationships will likely define our historical epoch and yet  many young technologists and humanists underestimate the downstream impact of technological innovations on human society. Presently  we have little choice but to attend to this rapidly anxiety-ridden question. This seminar will attend to the challenge of contemporary existential questions on what it means to be human (read not machine) in the context of a rapidly advancing technological age. We will consider human narratives throughout history that exam how governments and individual citizens defined humanity in the context of slavery and colonialism as a framework for exploring and projecting what it means to be human in the age of rapidly advancing intelligent machines. We will trace the technological advancements of the recent five decades and identify historical precedents and speculative narratives that help us to consider issues like labor  economic disparity  negotiations of power  human dignity and ethical responsibility within the context of human relations with advancing technological tools that are now coined  artificial intelligence.,Design,Testing

Financial and Managerial Accounting I,This course is the first of two required accounting courses designed to lay the accounting foundation necessary for any MBA students. Accounting is critical because accounting statements are the most common way of communication inside and outside a business entity. This first course introduces students to (1) corporate financial statements and (2) basic cost concepts and its uses. By the end of the course  you will have an improved ability to analyze the information content of financial and managerial accounting statements for decision making. To meet this broad objective  you will develop an analytic framework of how accounting statements inform about the underlying operating  investing  and financing activities  grasp the key accounting concepts that underlie common reporting practices  and understand the way in which accounting measures are sensitive to variations in estimates  methods and possible manipulation. The course divides naturally into three related parts. The first introduces the basic bookkeeping model  including the concepts  definitions  and relationships required for a fundamental understanding of the process that produces the balance sheet  income statement  and cash flow statement. The second part introduces basic concepts of economic and accounting costs and their use in short-term decisions faced by managers. The third part considers in more detail measurement and disclosure issues that are associated with assets  liabilities and equities shown in financial statements.,Reporting,Communication,Financial statements,Content,Process,Financing,Analyze,Accounting
Managerial Economics,This course presents the basic concepts of microeconomics theory with an emphasis on business applications. The approach of microeconomics is to solve an economic problem by modeling it as an optimization problem; the solution to the optimization problems then interpreted in terms of the original economic problem. This approach will be used to answer such problems as input selection  pricing and project selection. The format of the class is to present theory common to a general class of applied problems and then to apply the theory by solving actual problems. The goal of the class is for the students to be capable of applying the basic concepts to problems faced both future classes (e.g. finance  macroeconomics) and future careers.,Finance,Modeling
Global Economics,This class is designed to give you some insight into the enormous differences in economic environments faced by businesses around the world: how the environment in the United States differs from that in (say) France  China  or Mexico. We will view the world through the lens of open economy macroeconomics  the field of economics concerned with the national performance  policies of countries and interactions among them. We will use it to study such issues as economic indicators and forecasting (Where are we headed?)  economic growth (Why are some countries more productive than others?)  business cycles (booms and recessions)  employment and unemployment  inflation and deflation  monetary policy and interest rates  international trade and capital flows  foreign exchange rates  and impact of fiscal policy. By the end of the Mini  you will be able to: Better understand the behavior of the economy as a whole. Better understand the sources of the various controversies concerning macroeconomic policy. Explain how differences in ?local institutions change the nature (and cost) of doing business. Describe the causes of good long-term performance: why per capita income is higher in the US and France than in India or Mexico valuate such economic indicators as bond yields  employment  inflation  exchange rates and current account deficits.,Economics,Policies,International,Forecasting

Lean Entrepreneurship,Lean Entrepreneurship (45805) is one of two introductory entrepreneurship course offered to Tepper School of Business students and to graduate students from other CMU schools and colleges  as places are available. [The other introductory course is Entrepreneurial Alternatives (45806) this course targets entrepreneurial opportunities that include acquisition of businesses  family enterprises  franchises  social ventures and other means by which entrepreneurial principles may be applied]. Each of these two courses serves as a standalone as an introduction to entrepreneurship  and the courses also provide a background for those seeking an entrepreneurship concentration or an in-depth Track immersion. 45805 emphasizes developing an understanding of entrepreneurial thought  mindset  and action  and then progresses thru idea generation  and screening for patterns to predict success  and which underlie entrepreneurial decision making for enterprise creation and growth. The focus is on identification of recognizing the difference between an idea and an opportunity first. Then we progress on how to develop a competitive advantage and a sustainable business model that creates  captures  and delivers value to the market. High-growth ventures include tech-based ventures  small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with high growth potential  typically ranging from 20 to 50 annually (not lifestyle ventures). The course also incorporates some fundamental aspects of building a team and financing the opportunity  whether it is a technology-based  venture capital financed opportunity or other ventures more suitable for alternative financing vehicles. These latter two topics are included in more detail in subsequent courses.,Acquisition,Financing
Commercialization and Innovation: Strategy,Commercialization and Innovation  Strategy (45-807) focuses on innovation (transformational or disruptive innovations and by sustained innovations) and on the development of open innovation business models and market strategies required to introduce these innovations into the market  grow thru market share capture  and to establish dominant market positions. Students will gain a perspective of various current theories and models of innovation  how innovations are brought to the market and positioned for successful launch and subsequent growth. Students study and discuss both successful and unsuccessful attempts to bring innovations to the market via a series of lectures  readings  and case discussions. The first mini course focuses on the upfront strategic market thinking that must be the basis of a proactive and potent business plan to introduce innovations to the marketplace. It is the result of intense understanding of the SET factors (social  economic  and technology) and industry dynamics into which the opportunity will be introduced.

Interactive Marketing,Marketing strategy has at its core a customer-centered focus. Electronic media does not change this focus  but our ability to foster this interaction with technology has been dramatically increased. The Internet provides new forms of communications like web sites  e-mail  social media  and mobile communications. However  these technologies do not necessarily replace traditional marketing vehicles like mass media  direct mail  and telephone marketing  but instead augment them to improve the customer experience. The basic premise of this course is that these technologies can be used to fulfill the goal of a customer-centered marketing strategy. This course advocates an interactive marketing strategy as a framework for how to go about marketing to consumers with electronic tools. Interactive marketing evolves this strategy further by focusing not just on the companys interaction with the customer (e.g. advertising and direct communications) but the customers interaction with the company. This interaction has been enabled by electronic technology  such as the Internet  World Wide Web  E-mail  Instant Messaging  Search  and Social Media. The basic premise of the course is that these technologies (of which the Internet is the most prevalent) are bringing about radical changes in how markets work. These changes are brought about by cheap and powerful computing available to all members of the marketplace: customers  channels and producers.,Marketing,Mobile,Strategy,Interactive,Social media,Advertising
