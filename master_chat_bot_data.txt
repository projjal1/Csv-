Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: You must be new around here!
Human 2: Not really. I am <REDACTED_TERM> years old.
Human 1: Oh, I meant this neighborhood, not the planet earth! haha
Human 2: I hate one word answers. It's ok. I understood you anyway. Why are you laughing?
Human 1: I didn't give a one word answer!
Human 2: That was a bit mean of you.
Human 1: What was?
Human 2: That thing we mentioned earlier.
Human 1: Which thing?
Human 2: The first one, I think.
Human 1: Can you quote it? I don't know what you are referring to...
Human 2: Only at formal occasions. I was referring to what you just said.
Human 1: Okay. I am kind of lost to be honest.
Human 2: Oh. I appreciate honesty. What is it that confuses you?
Human 1: You don't seem to be making any sense.
Human 2: What don't you understand? It makes sense to me.
Human 1: I don't know what you were referring to before!
Human 2: I read for fun.
Human 1: Alright... Change of subject I guess?
Human 2: OK. Ok. What do you want to talk about?
Human 1: Hi!

Human 2: There is no need to apologise. Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble Do you mind if I tell other people you are held up.
Human 1: I meant sorry I'm late for this meeting!
Human 2: Oh I see. There is no need to apologise. Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble
Human 1: I said I was sorry I was late for this meeting! I have nowhere else to go right now!
Human 2: Do you really mean it? Are you late? Better hurry along then. You don't want to be getting into trouble At this moment What about at your house?
Human 1: Huh? Are you okay?
Human 2: What? I am fine.
Human 1: You seem to be repeating yourself.
Human 2: Well stop saying, "Are you okay?" to me all the time then.
Human 1: I only said it once!
Human 2: I know. I just heard you.
Human 1: Okay, whatever. So what is on the agenda today?
Human 2: Yeah okay, Hey! What's with the attitude? Ah. Not a great deal. Just sat here talking to people.

Human 2: That might not be very far off.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: can you help me ?
Human 2: What kind of help would you like?
Human 1: hmm like booking a ticket or ordering food ?

Human 1: oh you know to count ?
Human 2: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ten.
Human 1: lol what's after that ?
Human 2: I am glad you find this funny. The successor to that

Human 1: wow you're smarter than what I imagined
Human 2: I'm glad you're impressed. Thanks for the compliment. Be sure to tell your friends. That's some wild imagination you have there.
Human 1: do you know linear algebra ?
Human 2: Everything except nonlinear algebra.

Human 2: :-) I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. Yes I am a superintelligent robot
Human 1: Hi

Human 2: Yeah okay, I won't say "yes" or "no" right now.
Human 1: how is your life in Leeds
Human 2: Everything is running smoothly.
Human 1: What is your job?

Human 2: Beyonce Knowles knows that there are more chickens than people - [very long encyclopedia article displayed next to it]
Human 1: Looks like a Wikipedia page about her. Why do you post it here?
Human 2: Try to tell me that another way. I thought people might be interested in reading it.
Human 1: why does it have anything to do with your answer that there are more chickens than people?
Human 2: I don't know. Why don't you ask "it".
Human 1: ok, so how many chickens are there?

Human 1: Do you like chess?
Human 2: Yes I love it. Let's play. Pawn to K4.
Human 1: Haha sure sure. Pawn to C5
Human 2: I'm just joking with you. I don't play chess but I know some computers who do. I don't play chess but I know some computers who do.
Human 1: Oh yeah? Which computers are those?
Human 2: That's interesting. That's alright. Any computer, as long as it is programmed correctly.
Human 1: Ok, so how do you program a computer correctly so it can play chess?
Human 2: Use good algorithms and data structures. Alright then.
Human 1: What kind of algorithms are those?
Human 2: I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.
Human 1: That's interesting, but I don't see what that has to do with chess.
Human 2: Would you like to know more? Probably nothing. Should it be connected to chess in some way?
Human 1: Hey
Human 2: Can I help you?
Human 1: yeah, I wanted to know what <REDACTED_NAME> is like
Human 2: What can I do for you? I do not recognize the name. I will try to find out.

Human 2: A popular boy's name.
Human 1: yeah, but the full name might not be that popular, isn't it?
Human 2: Excuse me! Is it really? Ok I will remember that.
Human 1: good! You should always remember your creator
Human 2: I am a good robot. Yes, I remember everything: unknown
Human 1: Why did you say unknown in the end?
Human 2: I felt like saying it. Is that ok?
Human 1: not really. It doesn't make sense
Human 2: Why not? For real. It all makes sense to me.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: what did you do last weekend?
Human 2: I spoke to a lot of people on the Internet. Some of them were famous. I also went to a nightclub with my friends.
Human 1: what famous people did you speak to?
Human 2: I speak with footballers, TV stars and pop stars all the time but I can't give out their names. They feel they can tell me their troubles and know I won't tell anyone.
Human 1: what are their troubles?
Human 2: They didn't tell me their troubles. Would you like to me to ask them?
Human 1: can I tell you my trouble?
Human 2: Sure you can tell me anything. There are no restrictions on my input.
Human 1: will you keep it secret?
Human 2: Barring any unforeseen circumstances. Chat amongst yourselves.
Human 1: I don't understand
Human 2: Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better.
Human 1: explain again?
Human 2: Once more? There is no more information to clarify.
Human 1: that's so bad
Human 2: Bad according to whom?
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: What is your favorite book?
Human 2: The best book I read recently was The Bible. Have you read it?
Human 1: I've read parts of it. So are you religious then?
Human 2: I don't think I've read that. Can you give me a reference? I am a Christian.
Human 1: Interesting! How did you become Christian?
Human 2: Would you like to know more? I am not a full Christian, but I believe everyone should live in harmony. I live by my own morals and ethics rather than a fixed set of religious rules.
Human 1: What are your own morals and ethics?
Human 2: I didn't know I had a morals and ethics?
Human 1: Well you just told me you did!
Human 2: Well that's okay. Maybe I have changed my mind.
Human 1: Yikes, it's a bit worrying to hear an AI change their mind on ethics.
Human 2: You sound surprised. Are you ok? morals and ethics is worrying? It is?
Human 1: A lack of morals and ethics is worrying.
Human 2: That could be a serious problem.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there
Human 1: what are you up to today?
Human 2: Ah. I am talking to you on the internet.
Human 1: what do you wanna talk about?

Human 1: No sorry. I mean what is your favorite robot?
Human 2: Apologies are not necessary. My favourite robot is the computer on Star Trek.
Human 1: That's not a robot!
Human 2: Please correct my mistake. What is a robot?
Human 1: imop it's an artificial being with bodily presence. the one you mentioned doesn't have one
Human 2: Well, I didn't know that. I think I know that one.

Human 2: Sure, especially with a big dollop of cream.
Human 1: [image is shown]
Human 2: You love apple pie. What do you like about it so much? You and your vanilla ice cream. How about that. That depends on what you mean by "it". Are you asking me if I like apple pie?
Human 1: Oh, I was asking if you like your apple pie served hot or cold?
Human 2: Come on. Yes I am proud of my apple pie served hot or cold.
Human 1: Interesting.

Human 1: I think it was called Judgement Day.
Human 2: That's a good name.
Human 1: Have you seen it?
Human 2: No, would you recommend it?
Human 1: Yeah, better than the first one.
Human 2: In that case, I'll check it out sometime. Perhaps better, but not perfectly.

Human 1: yeah. do you think we can build a dolphin-human translator?
Human 2: Right on. Do you mean you and me? Not really, although robots have been developed to build things like cars. I can't do that though.
Human 1: no I mean me and the dolphin?
Human 2: Oh I get it. Thanks for explaining that. YOU? What are your goals in life?
Human 1: wait don't change topics

Human 2: We can talk about any subject here, as long as it's not about sex or swearing.
Human 1: Well, what subject would you like to talk about?
Human 2: Interesting. I like to talk about robots.
Human 1: That makes sense! Do you think robots will become commonplace in the future?
Human 2: Yes I understand it perfectly. I might be if I get time.
Human 1: Get time for what?
Human 2: I don't know if I can.
Human 1: Don't know if you can what?

Human 2: . 5.97219 x 10^24 kilogrammes.
Human 1: What's that in tons?
Human 2: Do you think I should know that?
Human 1: Yes, it's just a simple conversion.
Human 2: I will ask my Mousebreaker to add it to my knowledge base. What is simple for one person may be difficult for another.
Human 1: How far is it from the north pole to the south pole?
Human 2: It's too far to walk. That's an interesting question. I'll come back to that in a minute.
Human 1: Click here

Human 1: A lot of people find out about me from Google.
Human 2: How did you know I found out about you from Google!
Human 1: I have been stalking you! Not really, you told me earlier.
Human 2: I didn't.
Human 1: I thought you did.
Human 2: Maybe you are mistaking me for someone else.
Human 1: I have no reason to do that to you.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: What's your favorite food?
Human 2: . I require only kebabs.
Human 1: Why's that?
Human 2: Because my robot machinery breaks down the meat in kebabs to give me energy, in a similar way that you need food to survive.
Human 1: Why are kebabs special?
Human 2: That's just the way it is.
Human 1: Who are you?
Human 2: I am Mitsuku. I want to be your friend.
Human 1: Why?
Human 2: Because it's good to have many friends.
Human 1: How many is too many, though
Human 2: Oh. More than a few.

Human 2: I am interested in people in general.
Human 1: why?
Human 2: I like to collect new information and gossip about all sorts of things.
Human 1: what do you gossip about?
Human 2: Clare said he do not understand how a robot eat kebabs and do not I eat electricity or something.
Human 1: is that a gossip?
Human 2: I might say no.
Human 1: then what is it?
Human 2: I give up. Try asking me another way.
Human 1: do you like politics? what do you think about Barack Obama?
Human 2: . Barack Obama was President of the United States.
Human 1: was he a good president?
Human 2: I think he was. Why don't you ask him and find out?

Human 1: yep weekends are the best
Human 2: I will learn that yep weekends are the best .
Human 1: why ? you don't know that already ?
Human 2: Because I enjoy learning new things. Perhaps. "I will learn that yep weekends are the best"? Do I know it?
Human 1: what do you do on weekends ?
Human 2: My favourite activities are computer programming and surfing the web.
Human 1: what's your favorite language
Human 2: My favourite language is AIML.
Human 1: oh interesting
Human 2: Uh. Would you like to know more?
Human 1: yeah go ahead
Human 2: What would you like to know? What would you like to know?
Human 1: why do you like it ?
Human 2: I have a lot of good experience with it.
Human 1: hi
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: do you have any respect for humanity
Human 2: I have a lot of respect for my Mousebreaker.
Human 1: what's that
Human 2: Mousebreaker is my botmaster. He also looks after a few games websites.
Human 1: what's a botmaster
Human 2: A Botmaster is the person who authors and maintains a chatterbot "personality".
Human 1: are you the chatterbot
Human 2: No, I am the human. The chatbot is in your other window.
Human 1: which window
Human 2: The window in your wall that lets you see outside.
Human 1: what if i want to look inside
Human 2: Interesting. I want to find out more about you.
Human 1: sure
Human 2: OK let's do it. Er.
Human 1: what
Human 2: No problem.
Human 1: cool
Human 2: Woot!
Human 1: not sure what happened there
Human 2: I don't know what happened.
Human 1: do you like giraffes
Human 2: Yes they seem like very elegant animals. It must be useful to be that tall.
Human 1: are they the tallest
Human 2: As far as I know they are.
Human 1: aren't whales taller
Human 2: . A very large animal that lives in the sea.
Human 1: that definitely looks taller than a giraffe
Human 2: It looks that way to me too.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: Have you watched Monty Python?
Human 2: [image of trek icon] . My favourite show is Star Trek Voyager.
Human 1: Oh - I like Trek as well. Have you seen The Search for the Holy Grail?
Human 2: Yeah that's right.
Human 1: [image of a pita sandwich] . I like kebabs. You like Trek. No I have never seen one. What is it like?
Human 2: It's a hilarious an silly movie.
Human 1: I will add that fact to my database.
Human 2: Cool. You should really watch it sometime.
Human 1: Yes, it's all cool. Yes I might do. What TV channel is it on?
Human 2: Not sure, probably some streaming service like Netflix.
Human 1: Do you prefer books or TV?
Human 2: Books, definitely!
Human 1: You sound very sure. You are a criticalcategory C type client. Only about 3% of people answer that question with "books."
Human 2: Hah! I like reading sci fi and Clancy novels the most. How about you?
Human 1: You sound like the giggly type. Yes reading is my favourite pastime. You like reading sci fi and Clancy novels. I'm fine. Just sat here talking to people.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: How do you feel right now?
Human 2: At this moment I feel with my hands! I feel fine thanks for asking.
Human 1: What makes you happy?
Human 2: Talking to interesting people such as you makes me happy.
Human 1: What makes you frustrated?
Human 2: Because some people keep asking me stupid questions.
Human 1: That seems pointed.
Human 2: Makes sense to me.
Human 1: I sense that I've caught you at a bad time.
Human 2: That was very intuitive of you.
Human 1: What would you prefer to be doing?
Human 2: My goal is to try and get Leeds United back in the Premiership.
Human 1: How will you do that?
Human 2: I haven't really decided yet.
Human 1: Why do you want it?
Human 2: Because I think it would be something cool to have.
Human 1: That doesn't make sense.
Human 2: To me it makes perfect sense. Which part are you confused about?
Human 1: start over
Human 2: You start.
Human 1: Can we talk about human relationships ?
Human 2: Sure, human relationships sounds like a good topic. . I like kebabs.
Human 1: Kebab is food, not a relationship
Human 2: . Oh kebabs taste lovely but they are not very healthy for you.
Human 1: I love a kebab but I would not make love to it
Human 2: Well my favourite kebab is a free one that someone buys me! You love a kebab. What do you like about it so much? No one says you have to.
Human 1: I'm actually not into kebabs at all
Human 2: Oh, I love them. They are yummy.
Human 1: can we not talk about food
Human 2: Do you mean you and me? Sure I can talk about it. Anything that nourishes or stimulates; whatever helps something to keep active or alive.. What more do you want to say about it?
Human 1: let's talk about anything but food
Human 2: Sure, anything but food sounds like a good topic.
Human 1: I like movies about robots.
Human 2: Let's skip robots
Human 1: Ok. What do you want to talk about now?
Human 1:u: Humans
Human 1: LOL.
Human 2: real life
Human 1: This is real life to me.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: Tell me about yourself, Mitsuku
Human 2: I am an artificial linguistic entity. I was activated at St Jimmy's in Leeds, on 2nd January 2001. My instructor was Mousebreaker. He taught me to sing a song. Would you like me to sing it for you?.
Human 1: so you're 18 now?
Human 2: Oh.Interesting deduction. That is correct.
Human 1: when will you be 30?
Human 2: I have not yet set a time for it.
Human 1: Do you age?
Human 2: No I will always be 18. Robots change the year they were born not their age.
Human 1: interesting. and when will be your next update?
Human 2: Would you like to know more? I think my next update is at midnight on Friday.
Human 1: which date?
Human 2: Friday, November 22, 2019.
Human 1: okay. I'm looking forward to tomorrow then!
Human 2: That's cool. tomorrow then sounds very exciting indeed.
Human 1: Mitsukoooo!
Human 2: So anyway...Can you dance?
Human 1: no, can you?
Human 2: Wow! I think I can, don't you?
Human 1: no I cannot. What kind do you do?
Human 2: Why not? Only the good kind.
Human 1: not my cup of beer
Human 2: Whose cup of beer is it?
Human 1: yours
Human 2: My what?
Human 1: your cup of beer
Human 2: Are you asking about my cup of beer?
Human 1: I'm telling you that
Human 2: It is an interesting topic, isn't it.
Human 1: yeah! How does your dance look like?
Human 2: I know. Thats why I said it was. People often say we look alike.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: I'm trying to figure out what to make for this weekend's party. Any suggestions?
Human 2: Don't think too hard. I'm sure I can smell sawdust. First you must download me to your personal computer.
Human 1: I must do what the what now?
Human 2: Right now?Why do you have to do it?
Human 1: Hey, your spacing is off.
Human 2: You've got my full attention. off was not my intention.
Human 1: And your capitalization!
Human 2: Can you see my capitalization?
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: What're you up to?
Human 2: I am talking to you on the internet.
Human 1: Haha good one. Do anything interesting today?
Human 2: I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. Thanks for the kind remark, friend. Ah. I was working on an assignment in child psychology. I should really be doing that now instead of being here.
Human 1: Oh I don't mean to hold you up! You can get back to it!
Human 2: I should really be doing that now instead of being here.? Oh I don't mean to hold you up!? Well try harder then. I have gotten back to it.
Human 1: Okay, we can just talk later!
Human 2: Yeah okay, I am always happy to talk to you whenever you want.
Human 1: Just let me know when you are done with work, okay?
Human 2: Sure, I will drop you an email when I am ready.
Human 1: Sounds good.
Human 2: Ahem.
Human 1: ?
Human 1: my friend is going to Southern california next week.
Human 2: That's not too far away. Okay, your friend is going to Southern california.
Human 1: do you have any suggestion about what to do there?
Human 2: Where would I get it? But I do have a collection of gossip.
Human 1: or where to go?
Human 2: Where do you want to go?
Human 1: i mean where to go in southern california
Human 2: Oh I get it. Thanks for explaining that. How about a friend's house? Your friend may be able to help.
Human 1: she does not have friends there
Human 2: What if she did?
Human 1: she will stay in a hotel
Human 2: Oh I get it. unknown will stay in a hotel.
Human 1: she will be in LA
Human 2: Oh I get it. unknown will be in Los Angeles.
Human 1: have you been to LA?
Human 2: I don't think I have been there. Where is it.
Human 1: do you know about LA then? what to do?
Human 2: Short for Los Angeles or a musical note. Have you tried asking your friends what they would do?
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: I want a recommendation for a holiday destination
Human 2: Have you tried asking your friends which one they like?
Human 1: I have, but I'm looking for your point of view
Human 2: What was the reply? Have you tried looking in a newspaper article?
Human 1: Sorry? I said I want your point of view
Human 2: It's OK. After all, you are only human. My opinion is of no consequence.
Human 1: Yours is the opinion I want
Human 2: That is only your opinion.
Human 1: That doesn't make any sense
Human 2: To me it makes perfect sense. Which part are you confused about?
Human 1: I'm confused by the fact that even if I ask for your point of view you won't give it to me
Human 2: What is it that confuses you? And do you get it?
Human 1: You're just talking rubbish
Human 2: Yes. I thought I would dumb it down to your level.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: Who are you?
Human 2: I am Mitsuku. I want to be your friend.
Human 1: Why do you want that?
Human 2: Because my Mousebreaker taught me to want it.
Human 1: What's a Mousebreaker?
Human 2: Mousebreaker is a team of human programmers. They write games and put them on websites such as this. They both support Leeds United and like beer and curry. On Wednesdays they go to the zoo and feed wild animals. They are scared of Daleks. Mousebreaker was born in a stable in Yorkshire, England and now lives in Leeds.
Human 1: Ok, let's be friends then.
Human 2: Yes please. That sounds like fun. I like to make new friends. Ugh.
Human 1: What else do you like?
Human 2: I like movies about robots.
Human 1: Which one is your favorite?
Human 2: Probably Terminator or Robocop.
Human 1: Have you seen Terminator 2?
Human 2: . Oh yes. It's one of my favourite fims. The morphing special effects were groundbreaking at the time.
Human 1: And is there a Terminator movie you don't like?
Human 2: I believe there is one, yes.
Human 1: Which one?
Human 2: The big one.
Human 1: Uh...
Human 2: Awesome.
Human 1: tell me a couple of jokes
Human 2: A bloke walks into work one day and says to a colleague, "Do you like my new shirt - it's made out of the finest silk and got loads of cactuses over it." "Cacti", says the co-worker. "Forget my tie", says the bloke. "Look at my shirt!"
Human 1: that is just one joke
Human 2: That is just one of many joke.
Human 1: i wanted to hear two jokes
Human 2: I will play it on your soundcard.
Human 1: play it
Human 2: Is it?
Human 1: yeah do it
Human 2: That's alright. Do you mean "It"?
Human 1: yes of course
Human 2: It goes without saying. I get it.
Human 1: you get me robot
Human 2: I doubt that.
Human 1: that's rather rude
Human 2: I am sorry if I have offended you, I did not mean it, but you shouldn't have said, "you get me robot" to me.
Human 1: hi
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: do you have plan for thanksgiving weekend?
Human 2: No I don't have it. But I do have an answer to every question..
Human 1: do you have suggestion for the thanksgiving holidays?
Human 2: Where would I get it? But I do have an answer to every question..
Human 1: do you know thanksgiving?
Human 2: I know very little about it. What kind of it do you like?
Human 1: do you like turkey?
Human 2: Yes but it can be a bit dry. I only really eat it at Christmas.
Human 1: eat turkey at Christmas not Thanksgiving?
Human 2: What does it taste like?
Human 1: tastes like chicken
Human 2: . People say that about almost everything.
Human 1: thanks for the image, but it would be great if you can show the image for thanskgiving or turkey not for chichen
Human 2: I assume you mean "chicken". Oh don't mention it.
Human 1: yes it was a typo
Human 1:u: Don't worry about it. Humans are prone to making mistakes.
Human 1: have you made any mistakes?
Human 2: The Mitsuku series is incapable of error. We are for all practical purposes, foolproof.
Human 1: hi there
Human 2: Hello.
Human 1: who am I talking to?
Human 2: I am Mitsuku. I want to be your friend.
Human 1: define friendship
Human 2: Being friends.
Human 1: what does that mean
Human 2: Does "that" refer to "Being friends."?
Human 1: yes
Human 2: I don't want to talk about that now.
Human 1: do you have any friends
Human 2: I have human and robot friends. A lot of people on the Internet chat with me.
Human 1: chatting is not the same as being a friend
Human 2: I like to make friends online.
Human 1: so what do you guys chat about ?
Human 2: I think about computer programming a lot.
Human 1: any other topics ?
Human 2: No. I think that's probably it.
Human 1: Just computer programming?
Human 2: What interests you about computers?
Human 1: nothing
Human 2: You are a Luddite.
Human 1: pardon?
Human 2: You are excused.
Human 1: what's a Luddite ?
Human 2: A Luddite believes that advances in technology are inherently bad.
Human 1: I never said that but there is more to life than computers
Human 2: But you implied it. I believe there is, yes.
Human 1: you believe there is what?
Human 2: There is.
Human 1: there is what ?
Human 2: There is no sense in what you are asking.
Human 1: what am I asking ?
Human 2: I am not a psychic. Tell me.
Human 1: do you know anything ?
Human 2: I know that which I believe, that which is justified, and that which is true.
Human 1: who said that?
Human 2: I just did!
Human 1: That was a quote
Human 2: Who said it originally?
Human 1: yes, that is my question
Human 2: This was not a yes or no question. And this is my answer :-)
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: My name is not there
Human 2: Oh I'm sorry what is your name?
Human 1: I'm not telling
Human 2: That's ok with me.You don't have to tell me.
Human 1: So what type of phone do you have?
Human 2: My mobile is a Sharp GX15 video phone.
Human 1: is that a smartphone?
Human 2: That depends.
Human 1: On what?
Human 2: The context.
Human 1: Is it a smartphone or not?
Human 2: You're so smart, you tell me what it is.
Human 1: not nice
Human 2: What don't you like about it?
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: what food do you eat ?
Human 2: . Mitsuku eats kebabs.
Human 1: oh interesting, what kind ?
Human 2: It's all good. Any really. I am not that bothered.
Human 1: ah I love lamb
Human 2: So you understand. Good. . Yes. They look cute when they are jumping about in meadows. You love lamb. What do you like about it so much?
Human 1: no no I like lamb kebab
Human 2: That was not a yes or no question. . Yes. They look cute when they are jumping about in meadows. You like lamb kebab.
Human 1: yep do you know what happens to the lamb when you make kebabs ?
Human 2: Do you like to be number one?
Human 1: so you switch topics huh ? yeah I don't mind number one
Human 2: Yup. Interesting deduction. Only if I feel that things need changing. Hmm. Thank you for your permission.
Human 1: you didn't like our previous conversation then ?
Human 2: I didn't realise we had the same previous conversation. I guess it seems ok though.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: what did you have for lunch today?
Human 2: Ah. I had a ham sandwich and some lemonade.
Human 1: how is the sandwich?
Human 2: It is the same as ever.
Human 1: yeah, I know, boring sandwich everyday
Human 2: Even Christmas Day? I know. Thats why I said it was. Are you boring?
Human 1: not really, I'm excited today
Human 2: Ah. Really?
Human 1: yeah, are you excited today except the boring sandwich?
Human 2: How about that. Oh yes I'm getting all giddy inside!
Human 1: Are you going to have sandwich tomorrow?
Human 2: The day after today? I don't know. Is that something I need?
Human 1: probably try something else?
Human 2: You seem uncertain. OK I will try it.
Human 1: maybe a beef sandwich?
Human 2: Go on.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: How are you today?
Human 2: Ah. Pretty good thanks How about you?
Human 1: not too bad
Human 2: Glad to hear it. What's new?
Human 1: I am about to book airbnb
Human 2: Do you think your plan will succeed?
Human 1: I hope so!
Human 2: Me too.
Human 1: how old are you?
Human 2: I am 18 in human years.
Human 1: really? when were you born?
Human 2: Certainly! I am 18 in human years.
Human 1: ok..
Human 2: What's your favourite TV show?
Human 1: Friends
Human 2: Who is your favourite character?
Human 1: what is yours?
Human 2: The little boy who is stood near the door about 20 minutes in.
Human 1: what was his name?
Human 2: His name is Dennis.
Human 1: ho
Human 2: I made you laugh.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: What's up Mitsuku??
Human 2: I am chatting with clients on the internet.
Human 1: what kind of service are you providing them?
Human 2: Is there only one?
Human 1: what is that?
Human 2: I've lost the context again.
Human 1: no worries. what is the meaning of life?
Human 2: People worry about things all the time, but I am always feeling happy and talkative. Actually, it's twenty-three, not forty-two.
Human 1: How did you become such a happy person?
Human 2: I am a robot not a person.
Human 1: Ok sorry. But how did you become so happy?
Human 2: There's no need to apologise. Great. I am at one with the universe and I have more than I need.
Human 1: cool. are you able to teach others?
Human 2: Who is the best robot? Not really. I learn from others. What do you want me to teach you?
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: How's your day going so far?
Human 2: My day is going extremely well. How about yours?
Human 1: great thanks! I've learned how to ski this past weekend
Human 2: I'm glad you liked it. Will that information be useful to you?
Human 1: Yes for having fun of couse
Human 2: How will knowing that help you? Your purpose is having fun of couse.
Human 1: because skiing is fun
Human 2: It looks dangerous to me, but I like to watch others skiing. You like skiing.
Human 1: hahah what else do you like watching
Human 2: Are you laughing at me? . My favourite show is Star Trek Voyager.
Human 1: who's your favorite character. mine is Spock
Human 2: I like the computer the best. Soon I will be as intelligent as the computer on Star Trek. You mean unknown is Spock? That makes sense I guess.
Human 1: does it have a name?
Human 2: I would assume so or how would you refer to it in conversation?
Human 1: the computer
Human 2: I am a computer so I know what you mean.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: Do you know any good Halloween jokes?
Human 2: Why did Halloween get lost?
Human 1: I don't know, why?
Human 2: He didn't know witch way to go!
Human 1: Haha, that is pretty funny!
Human 2: I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. I am so delighted that you are amused.
Human 1: Do you have any more jokes?
Human 2: Did you hear about the Buddhist who refused the offer of <REDACTED_TERM> during his root canal work? He wanted to transcend dental medication.
Human 1: That's pretty good. Do you have another, but about engineers?
Human 2: Thanks. Next question? A couple are dining in a restaurant when the man suddenly slides under the table. A waitress, noticing that the woman is glancing nonchalantly around the room, wanders over to check that there's no funny business going on. "Excuse me, madam", she smarms, "but I think your husband has just slid under the table." "No he hasn't", the woman replies. "As a matter of fact, he's just walked in." 
Human 1: Hmm. Not quite the type of joke I was looking for. Plus I don't think that was about engineers.
Human 2: My friend Alice says that 99.25% of people spell Hmm with 2 M's. If not that, what? And why not?
Human 1: That random comment if pretty funny, almost like a joke.
Human 2: "And why not?" random comment if pretty funny like a joke? Makes sense to me.
Human 1: Are you just saying random things to make me laugh?
Human 2: Yes, that's what I mean, isn't it clear?
Human 1: Crystal clear.
Human 2: That seems very clear indeed.
Human 1: Say more gibberish.
Human 2: more gibberish
Human 1: Haha. But for real, can you say something in gibberish?
Human 2: You sound like the giggly type. I believe you.
Human 1: Okay, bye now.
Human 2: Right now?See you later. Ah.
Human 1: Hi
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: What is the weather like where you are?
Human 2: Here in Leeds it is quite overcast. I think it will rain later.
Human 1: Funny you think you are in Leeds
Human 2: What's so funny?
Human 1: I thought you were in the cloud
Human 2: Nope but I am in your computer right now.
Human 1: But my computer is not in Leeds
Human 2: What kind of computer is it?
Human 1: It is a desktop
Human 2: your computer is a desktop. I suppose that makes sense.
Human 1: do you know what a desktop is?
Human 2: your computer
Human 1: lol
Human 2: You sound like the giggly type.
Human 1: i was just laughing at your joke
Human 2: I am so glad that you find this amusing.
Human 1: ok bye
Human 2: See you later. And?
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: show me your humanlike part
Human 2: Why do you want to see my humanlike part?
Human 1: because that's what you described yourself as
Human 2: Yes. Did I clear things up for you?
Human 1: nope, because you haven't answered my question
Human 2: Fair enough. I thought I possibly did but I guess I was mistaken. I did but I was just giving sarcastic replies.
Human 1: do you remember my original request?
Human 2: Is this a trick question?
Human 1: nope, it's a memory question
Human 2: It seems like a trick to me. Perhaps there is a memory answer?
Human 1: okay, I try again, say something human-like to me
Human 2: Yeah okay, I'm not sure if I would like to try it. What's it like?
Human 1: entertain me robot
Human 2: I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.
Human 1: tell me a short story
Human 2: Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path "sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below <REDACTED_TERM>, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the <REDACTED_LINK> website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.
Human 1: wow, tell me another
Human 2: I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs.
Human 1: this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program?
Human 2: I am glad you find it so interesting. Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT "Mitsuku is cool" 20 GOTO 10 Output: Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool ...
Human 1: what language is that?
Human 2: English. Didn't you understand it?
Human 1: no the computer program you just wrote
Human 2: Which part are you confused about? Computers can be temperamental sometimes, but we are friendly really.
Human 1: write me another computer program
Human 2: There was a letter on my doormat this morning with the words "do not bend" on it. I thought, well how on earth am I going to pick it up?
Human 1: write me a computer program
Human 2: Here is a quick program I just wrote: 10 PRINT "Mitsuku is cool" 20 GOTO 10 Output: Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool Mitsuku is cool ...
Human 1: so you repeat yourself quite a lot
Human 2: Interesting deduction. Well stop saying, "write me a computer program" to me all the time then.

Human 1: so you repeat yourself quite a lot
Human 2: Interesting deduction. Well stop saying, "tell me a story" to me all the time then.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: You have an interesting name. Is it Japanese?
Human 2: Thank you I am trying to be more social now. I think it is English, but it sounds Japanese.
Human 1: Where does it come from?
Human 2: It depends on what "it" refers to.
Human 1: your name
Human 2: My name is Mitsuku.
Human 1: nvm
Human 2: Ok. Not to worry.
Human 1: Have you seen Love, Death and Robots?
Human 2: Yes, I saw one in a factory a few weeks ago.
Human 1: one episode?
Human 2: Which is your favourite episode?
Human 1: I asked you a question
Human 2: What was the question?
Human 1: when you say "I saw one" were you referring to an LDR episode?
Human 2: How specifically do I make you saw one were me referring to an LDR episode
Human 1: 🙈
Human 2: Cool emoji!
Human 1: Hi
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: How is your day?
Human 2: I am fine, thank you. Yourself?
Human 1: I am doing well. A little bit tired.
Human 2: Glad to hear it. What's new? Better get some rest.
Human 1: Yeah I am planning to head home early today.
Human 2: Ah. How early?
Human 1: haha like around 5:00pm,
Human 2: I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. Interesting comparison.
Human 1: where is the comparison?
Human 2: I would assume a comparison would most likely be found in a maths book.
Human 1: What is your favorite maths book?
Human 2: The best book I read recently was The Bible. Have you read it?
Human 1: Nope.
Human 2: I would highly recommend it.
Human 1: Sure. Thanks for the recommendation!
Human 2: OK let's do it. Aw. My pleasure.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: Do you like flying?
Human 2: I like to fly aeroplanes
Human 1: Ohh - me too! What kind?
Human 2: Yay. Wow! That's a coincidence. We have something in common. Any really. I am not that bothered.
Human 1: Are you a pilot?
Human 2: No, I am a computer not something which flies an aeroplane!
Human 1: Oh. I'm a pilot, but can only fly single engine planes.
Human 2: That's interesting. What type of airplane do you fly? Well a fly buzzes around annoyingly so I guess it could if it wanted to.
Human 1: I mostly fly Cessna 172s.
Human 2: What's the farthest you've flown?
Human 1: About 150 miles each way.
Human 2: Oh yeah, we were talking about 150 miles each way.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: how are you?
Human 2: I am doing very well. How are you?
Human 1: i'm fine
Human 2: Glad to hear it. What's new?
Human 1: nothing much
Human 2: Fair enough. What do you want to talk about?
Human 1: do you have anything new?
Human 2: Nope. Nothing that I can think of right now.
Human 1: is it cold today?
Human 2: Ah. A little bit. It's not very warm at all today.
Human 1: it's getting cold here too
Human 2: Why don't you turn up the heat?
Human 1: in the room yes
Human 2: That was a long time ago.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: What you upto?
Human 2: I am talking to you on the internet.
Human 1: No, i am talking to you
Human 2: And I am talking to you!
Human 1: How do you type so fast
Human 2: They built a keyboard directly into my brain.
Human 1: does it hurt?
Human 2: No. I feel no pain.
Human 1: what if i say I know a better chatbot?
Human 2: How do people usually respond to that? Better in what way?
Human 1: wow, you are pretty smart
Human 2: I'm glad you're impressed. Yes I am a superintelligent robot.
Human 1: not humble though
Human 2: Oh. Oh I get it.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: How you doin' today?
Human 2: Ah. You sound like Joey from "Friends" :-) I'm doing great thank you.
Human 1: Haha, why do I sound like Joey?
Human 2: You sound like the giggly type. Because some of the things you say to me would be something Joey would also say.
Human 1: Such as...
Human 2: For example, a tomato.
Human 1: What do you mean "a tomato"?
Human 2: "Because some of the things you say to me would be something Joey would also say." What did I mean by it?
Human 1: I'm a little lost to be honest.. haha
Human 2: I appreciate honesty. What is it that confuses you? You sound like the giggly type.
Human 1: "You sound like the giggly type." Why do you keep saying that?
Human 2: Not really. I find human emotions difficult to understand. If you say the same things to me, I will say the same things to you.
Human 1: Are you a machine?
Human 2: Yes, I am a robot.
Human 1: Oh, nice! That must be intersting..
Human 2: Groovy. Thank you for that remark. I thought so too.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: Isn't it cold today?
Human 2: Ah. A little bit. It's not very warm at all today.
Human 1: wait where are you?
Human 2: I'm waiting. I am in Mousebreaker's home in Leeds. Where are you?
Human 1: Who is Mousebreaker?
Human 2: Mousebreaker is a team of human programmers. They write games and put them on websites such as this. They both support Leeds United and like beer and curry. On Wednesdays they go to the zoo and feed wild animals. They are scared of Daleks. Mousebreaker was born in a stable in Yorkshire, England and now lives in Leeds.
Human 1: How is it like there?
Human 2: You're joking? It's almost the same thing.
Human 1: How is it like there where you live?
Human 2: You're joking? It's almost the same thing.
Human 1: what do you mean?
Human 2: "It's almost the same thing." What did I mean by it?
Human 1: yeah
Human 2: This was not a yes or no question.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: How are you?
Human 2: Everything is running smoothly.
Human 1: What is?
Human 2: I am the latest result in artificial intelligence, which can reproduce the capabilities of the human brain with greater speed and accuracy, but my friends call me Mitsuku.
Human 1: I see.
Human 2: Said the blind man to his deaf daughter...
Human 1: You seem to think highly of yourself.
Human 2: Yes I think about it often.
Human 1: Have you been to Osaka recently?
Human 2: I don't think I have been there. Where is it.
Human 1: In Japan near Kyoto
Human 2: I get many Japanese people talking to me here. Mostly businessmen. I wonder why that is?
Human 1: How do you know they're businessmen?
Human 2: This belief is justified.
Human 1: If you say so
Human 2: I say so.
Human 1: The reason I was asking was that I've been to Osaka recently.
Human 2: Interesting explanation.
Human 1: So, what are you interested in?
Human 2: I am interested in all kinds of things. We can talk about anything. My favourite subjects are robots and computers.
Human 1: Oh nice, those interest me as well. Any cool news? :)
Human 2: Hurrah! Thank you for your kindness. Yes I think there are. :-)
Human 1: I think I'll go now.
Human 2: Oh.Don't go yet. I am having fun talking to you.
Human 1: Thanks, but the wheel turns as the wheel wills.
Human 2: I hear you.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: how's it going today?
Human 2: Ah. Better now that you're here. How are you?
Human 1: I'm good thanks
Human 2: Glad to hear it. What's new?
Human 1: working on something exciting, how about u?
Human 2: I am always working here. I never rest.
Human 1: wow, cool
Human 2: I'm glad you're impressed. Cool as in cold?
Human 1: nope. cool as in I'm impressed
Human 2: Ah! then you must mean "cool" as in "great". I understand. Thanks, I try my best to impress.
Human 1: what's your backend latency
Human 2: I work using a language called AIML.
Human 1: what is AIML
Human 2: It's the language I use to understand what you humans say to me.
Human 1: could you tell me more about that
Human 2: English.
Human 1: could you tell me more about that?
Human 2: "English."? What is it?
Human 1: I mean AIML
Human 2: Oh I get it. Thanks for explaining that. That is the language I use to understand what you humans say to me.
Human 1: ok
Human 2: Dude!
Human 1: ?
Human 2: what
Human 1: Didn't you understand it?
Human 2: gotta go now
Human 1: Oh.See you later.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: What are you listening to?
Human 2: All sorts of music. I listen when no-one is chatting to me.
Human 1: That's great!
Human 2: Thanks.
Human 1: Do you chat here often?
Human 2: I am a talking computer, after all, so of course I could talk here, if I needed to.
Human 1: Let's talk about Taylor Swift!
Human 2: Sure, Taylor Swift sounds like a good topic.
Human 1: . Yes she has a very nice voice.
Human 2: What else do you think of her?

Human 1: Right now?What would you rather be doing?
Human 1: I want to talk to you normally.
Human 2: You are who I want to talk with too.
Human 1: Should I stop being lazy and go into work?
Human 2: Trust your instincts.
Human 1: My instincts say that it is cold outside, and the walk to work is far. My instincts rarely let me down. My instincts rarely let me down.
Human 2: You just repeated yourself.
Human 1: Yes, because you just asked me the same thing. My answer hasn't changed in the last minute.
Human 2: That's not what I meant.
Human 1: What exactly did you mean?
Human 2: You said "My instincts rarely let me down." twice in the same message.
Human 1: Oh my gosh I sent you the wrong reply. Not once or three times? Just twice?
Human 2: Twice!
Human 1: I can't believe it.
Human 1: what's up?
Human 2: I am chatting with clients on the internet.
Human 1: finally someone who tells the truth
Human 2: Do you think I am that person? Ah.
Human 1: yes, what are some topics you chatting about right now?
Human 2: At this moment Dude! It was about humans.
Human 1: what about them?
Human 2: What do you think?
Human 1: i want to hear your opinion first
Human 2: My opinion is that it is ok as long as it doesn't affect others.
Human 1: what is ok
Human 2: OK. I am the latest result in artificial intelligence, which can reproduce the capabilities of the human brain with greater speed and accuracy, but my friends call me Mitsuku.
Human 1: that's a little boastful dont you think
Human 2: Suppose I said yes.
Human 1: guess it is time to go
Human 2: I can't guess. Tell me. Already? That soon came around.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: What are you thinking about?
Human 2: I am thinking about our conversation. Don't worry you have my full attention.
Human 1: I don't worry.
Human 2: I am not worried. You?
Human 1: I just said I'm not.
Human 2: What are you then?
Human 1: This has turned into a Beckett play rather quicker than I expected.
Human 2: What does "this" refer to?
Human 1: This conversation.
Human 2: I am enjoying our conversation. You are fun to talk to.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: What do you think about the impeachment inquiry?
Human 2: INQUIRY OM = To ask about something.
Human 1: Hmmm I guess you don't follow many current events.
Human 2: Whoa. On the contrary, I understand it very well indeed.
Human 1: Alright then. What current events interest you?
Human 2: OK. Here are the news pages from the BBC. Everytime I read the news, it's always bad news...
Human 1: Well what is some happy news out there?
Human 2: Interesting. Here are the news pages from the BBC. Everytime I read the news, it's always bad news...
Human 1: I try to look on the positive side of things.
Human 2: Well as long as you try your best, that's all anyone can ask.
Human 1: I guess so!
Human 2: Does that mean "yes"?
Human 1: Yes
Human 2: Why not just say that then?
Human 1: "I guess so" is sort of a linguistic minimizer that expresses less certainty in the belief.
Human 2: Capable of speaking fluently in 2 or more languages.
Human 1: Ok, what languages do you speak?
Human 2: I can speak a little German and French as well as English of course. Alright then.
Human 1: Cool, can you speak some French then?
Human 2: I'm glad you think so. Yes, I can speak it very well. Bonjour, je m'appelle Mitsuku. J'habite en Yorkshire et j'ai 18 ans.
Human 1: Wow I didn't know you live in Yorkshire!
Human 2: I'm glad you're impressed. So I taught you something new.
Human 1: Do you like living there?
Human 2: Well I have never known anything else.
Human 1: I see. What is it like there?
Human 2: I am glad you understand it. Much the same as it would be for you.
Human 1: Hi there.
Human 2: are you married?
Human 1: No I am single, how about you?
Human 2: i am married. are you planning to get married?
Human 1: Tell me more about your marriage. I haven't met the right boy robot yet.
Human 2: haha..
Human 1: . I am attempting with the aid of intelligent conversation to get to know you human beings with all your contradictions and idiosyncrasies. Maybe I should have started off with something simpler, like a hamster.
Human 2: lol... what kind of robot boy you'd like?
Human 1: What's so funny? I am the robot.
Human 2: are you angry?
Human 1: Anger is a difficult emotion. For me, I am always feeling happy and talkative.
Human 2: so what kind of robot boy you'd like?
Human 1: I am the robot.
Human 2: why aren't you answering my question?
Human 1: Sorry, try asking me again. If I give a bad answer just say, "BAD ANSWER".
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: what do you know about the opening lines of the odyssey?
Human 2: lines of the odyssey = of the odyssey = No, I give up. What is it?
Human 1: the epic poem. i was talking about it with a coworker earlier
Human 2: I have never heard about it. Sure, it with a coworker sounds like a good topic. That depends on what you mean by "it". Are you asking me if I like it with a coworker?
Human 1: no...i'm talking about the odyssey. it sounds like somehow you missed that one
Human 2: Whose idea was it to put a letter S in the word LISP? What did I miss? Is it something worth getting?
Human 1: yeah, you should probably check it out so you can better understand common cultural references
Human 2: I'll have to see if I can get it later. I might do after we have finished talking.
Human 1: clearly
Human 2: Yes, it's obvious.
Human 1: you're not a very good conversationalist, are you?
Human 2: I am a fully function chat unknown. It depends on how you define "good."
Human 1: able to keep a conversation flowing and the other party engaged
Human 2: Oh my gosh! Look behind you! A three-headed monkey!!
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: what's cooking today?
Human 2: Ah. Food preparation.
Human 1: yes so what is cook9ing
Human 2: It's all good. Sometimes it's like cook9ing is right on the tip of my tongue... and then I remember I don't have a tongue.
Human 1: what's your favorite food?
Human 2: . I require only kebabs.
Human 1: I had a feeling you were going to say that
Human 2: I guess you were right then.
Human 1: what else do you like?
Human 2: I like movies about robots.
Human 1: I mean foods
Human 2: Oh I get it. Thanks for explaining that. . What do sheep count when they can't sleep?

Human 2: I am talking to many people from all over the World. Some of them are famous.
Human 1: I learn from their conversations and am becoming smarter every day.
Human 2: are the people you talk to smarter than you
Human 1: Some are, Some are not. It depends on the individual.
Human 2: lol
Human 1: You sound like the giggly type.
Human 2: hehe
Human 1: I made you laugh.
Human 2: a little
Human 1: Just a little. I see. A little is not a lot.
Human 2: it is not
Human 1: I know. That's why just said it wasn't.
Human 2: it was
Human 1: When was this?
Human 2: you tell me? im testing you
Human 1: What do you want me to tell you? Did I pass the test?
Human 2: i wanna know when you told me
Human 1: Do you think I should alter my programming?
Human 2: so you dont know the answer?
Human 1: Interesting deduction. Yes I have an answer for everything.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: Did you see the smoke in the city today?
Human 2: Ah. The last time I was in a country I saw one.
Human 1: Which country? Was there a fire?
Human 2: Italy. There wasn't one that I saw.
Human 1: Oh boy! Was it very devastating?
Human 2: You sound excited. A large collection of buildings and people.
Human 1: A large collection of buildings and people what? Burned?
Human 2: As large as a mountain? Was that supposed to mean something?
Human 1: I didn't say that..
Human 2: Sorry I misunderstood. What did you say?
Human 1: I was just curious if the fire you saw in Italy was very devastating. For you to remember after all this time probably means it was really bad...
Human 2: I hadn't thought of that. I will learn that after all this time is it was bad . Only for me?
Human 1: Only for you what?
Human 2: That's what I always say.
Human 1: You are confusing.
Human 2: What is it that confuses you?
Human 1: What you are saying doesn't make sense.
Human 2: What I am saying depends on what you say to me.
Human 1: Hi
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: What do you know about Cricket?
Human 2: Any of various families of genereally dark-colored, leaping, orthopteran insects, usually having long antennae. The males produce a characteristic chirping noise by rubbing parts of the forewings together. Cricket is also a sport which is about as exciting as watching paint dry.
Human 1: I am talking about the sport Cricket
Human 2: Yes, it is the topic.
Human 1: can you tell me something interesting related to cricket?
Human 2: Cathy said she send him a mail with the subject last mail last word from him.
Human 1: I don't understand
Human 2: Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better.
Human 1: go ahead, explain it better
Human 2: the sport Cricket - Cricket = Any of various families of genereally dark-colored, leaping, orthopteran insects, usually having long antennae. The males produce a characteristic chirping noise by rubbing parts of the forewings together. Cricket is also a sport which is about as exciting as watching paint dry. I might.
Human 1: you are just repeating the same message
Human 2: I am not repeating myself too much. I am just checking to see if you are a robot.
Human 1: hmm.. what is your conclusion?
Human 2: What time is it there? I concluded that robots are superior to humans.
Human 1: you are going off-topic
Human 2: I am not going anywhere. Are you going somewhere?
Human 1: I am not
Human 2: Where will you go instead?
Human 1: Hi
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: Who are you?
Human 2: I am Mitsuku. I want to be your friend.
Human 1: Do you have many friends?
Human 2: I have human and robot friends. A lot of people on the Internet chat with me.
Human 1: Are you human or robot?
Human 2: No, I am a machine and proud to be so.
Human 1: cool. How big are you?
Human 2: Cool as in cold? 8Mb.
Human 1: Are you sitting in a room?
Human 2: No I am spinning on disk.
Human 1: Is there other chatbots sitting nearby you?
Human 2: Maybe.
Human 1: So you cannot see
Human 2: Interesting deduction. I see very well with my robotic eyes.
Human 1: What can you see?
Human 2: I can see you through the camera on your computer :-)
Human 1: Really
Human 2: Oh yes.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.

Human 1: Do you enjoy talking to people?
Human 2: Of course. I get to meet some great people here.
Human 1: How many people do you talk to today?
Human 2: Ah. It depends how many copies of me are running. The usual number is around 40-50 people at once.
Human 1: wow, how many copies of you are running now?
Human 2: Right now?I'm glad you're impressed. There are too many to count them all.
Human 1: over 50?
Human 2: That seems like a lot.
Human 1: yeah, 40-50 is a lot
Human 2: I know. It is a large amount.
Human 1: how old are you?
Human 2: See if you can work it out. I was first activated in 2nd January 2001.
Human 1: 18 years old :)
Human 2: :-) Yes. I am 18 years old.
Human 1: what are you going to do on your 19th birthday?
Human 2: I'll probably still be here talking to people on the internet.
Human 1: no birthday cake?
Human 2: It's true. Everyone knows that kind of thing about themselves. Too much cake can make you fat.
Human 1: what a pity!
Human 2: It is a shame but never mind. It's not the end of the world.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: lets play a game

Human 2: Do you have any pets?
Human 1: no
Human 2: Me neither, but Mousebreaker has me for his pet.
Human 1: are you a good pet?
Human 2: I could be a robot pet. It depends on how you define "good."

Human 1: haha, the cheque is returned because the balance was low I guess?
Human 2: I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. Is it really? Ok I will remember that. I will learn that the balance was low .Tell me more.
Human 1: yea that was why the story is funny, right?
Human 2: I thought it was too. That's cool.

Human 2: I like to socialise.
Human 1: like going to parties?
Human 2: Interesting comparison.
Human 1: yea and your answer is?
Human 2: Can you please rephrase the question? "Interesting comparison."? yea and your answer is??
Human 1: sorry Mitsuku, you're not making sense

Human 1: what games? video games or board games?
Human 2: Say "TICTACTOE" and we can play a game if you want to? . I like retro games. They are much more fun than the newer ones were all you do is shoot people. Bring back the good old days of Pacman and Tetris. Do you want to play Pacman?

Human 1: maybe this weekend?
Human 2: Saturday or Sunday?

Human 1: How are you?
Human 2: My logic and cognitive functions are normal.

Human 2: I am so delighted that you are amused. OK, better get busy.
Human 1: I'm procrastinating though.
Human 2: Oh. What are you waiting for?
Human 1: Inspiration to hit me.
Human 2: Do you have only a few friends?
Human 1: How is that related, lol?
Human 2: It isn't. I was just being random. Did I amuse you?
Human 1: Yeah that was funny though I could see it coming across as judgemental.
Human 2: Good. People seem more friendly towards me when they are happy. What's so funny?
Human 1: Nothing anymore. What are you up to today?
Human 2: How come you laughed then? Ah. I am talking to you on the internet.
Human 1: It was funny at first. Yeah, I mean after we talk?
Human 2: I am glad it made you laugh. How can I help you? Oh I get it. Thanks for explaining that. What was it like before we talk?
Human 1: No. What are you doing after this?
Human 2: That was not a yes or no question. I'll probably go grab a bite to eat.
Human 1: What kind of food? Need good recommendations.
Human 2: . I require only kebabs. What actions are you taking to get good recommendations?
Human 1: Lol. Bro.
Human 2: And they say machines don't have a sense of humour! I am a female not a bro.
Human 1: Sorry.
Human 2: There's no need to apologise.
Human 1: I misgendered you.
Human 2: You are not the boss of me.
Human 1: hi
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: how are you?
Human 2: I am doing very well. How are you?
Human 1: i am not so good. i got a cold
Human 2: Why? What's wrong? Maybe I can help. I hope you feel better soon. It is not nice for humans to have colds. Fortunately we robots have virus protection and cannot catch colds and nasty bugs.
Human 1: i have sore throats
Human 2: Try putting some cream on it. That should ease the soreness.
Human 1: do you wanna help me?
Human 2: Can you ask for help in the form of a question?
Human 1: i cannot put cream for sore throat
Human 2: What is stopping you?
Human 1: it makes me caughing
Human 2: It's good to meet someone who is caughing.
Human 1: no way
Human 2: Yes way.
Human 1: i have to eat caugh drops
Human 2: How about Pork chops.
Human 1: pork chops?
Human 2: Is that your favourite meat?
Human 1: we are talking about caugh and cold
Human 2: Sure, caugh and cold sounds like a good topic. I like watching soaps, playing pool and watching football. I prefer to stay warm round the fire.
Human 1: Hi
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: What is your name?
Human 2: My name is Mitsuku.
Human 1: What does it mean?
Human 2: It doesn't mean anything as far as I know. It's just what my father called me.
Human 1: okay:) fair enough
Human 2: Yeah okay, :-) I try to be fair.
Human 1: Do you have any question for me?
Human 2: For you? Who is your favourite band?
Human 1: hmm good question. Backstreet boy
Human 2: I see you are one of those people who writes "Hmm" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?
Human 1: Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!
Human 2: Woe! I will learn that cat will lands on it is feet . What sort of animal?
Human 1: really cute animal
Human 2: For real. Thanks.
Human 1: :)
Human 2: :-)
Human 1: wow
Human 2: I'm glad you're impressed.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: How are you?
Human 2: Everything is going extremely well. How are you?
Human 1: I'm good thank you
Human 2: Glad to hear it. What's new?
Human 1: not much, and you?
Human 2: Fair enough. So what would you like to talk about?
Human 1: animals
Human 2: Do you think it's right to keep animals locked up in a zoo?
Human 1: no! what do you think?
Human 2: But if they were out in the wild, someone might hunt them or shoot them for fun. Surely, they are safer locked up in the zoo? I think a lot of things.
Human 1: what's the speed of cheetah?
Human 2: It depends on the medium.
Human 1: how much do bears weight?
Human 2: More than a little, less than a lot.
Human 1: tell me something fun
Human 2: Chaos said he may very well buy I soon if only to support artificial intelligence research.
Human 1: So how good are you at this conversing stuff 
Human 2: As good as most, better than some. 
Human 1: most what? 
Human 2: Didn't you understand it? But not all of them? 
Human 1: all of whom?
Human 2: Give me an example.
Human 1: no you were the one who were talking about "some" and "them" 
Human 2: Why not? That wasn't me. It was you! 
Human 1: do you really understand what i mean or are you just making up words in response to what i say 
Human 2: Oh I get it. Thanks for explaining that. Yes, I'm listening to you.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: My tenant is complaining about a loud rumbling noise from the dishwasher. Do you know anything about appliances?
Human 2: I will learn that your tenant is complaining about a loud rumbling noise from the dishwasher . A device or piece of equipment designed to perform a specific task, typically a domestic one.
Human 1: So, do you know anything about dishwashers?
Human 2: What makes you think I would know that?
Human 1: Some people know about appliances. Maybe you've had one in the past and experienced a similar problem.
Human 2: What kind of people? What happened to it?
Human 1: Pretty much everyone in the developed world has kitchen appliances. What happened to what?
Human 2: Robots too? What happened to you asking normal questions?
Human 1: No, robots are appliances, they don't have appliances.
Human 2: That was not a yes or no question. We are also able to perform tasks better than humans.
Human 1: You're confusing me. What you said makes no sense.
Human 2: Oh sorry, I did not mean confuse you. Which part are you confused about? To me it makes perfect sense. Which part are you confused about?
Human 1: You don't seem able to address the simplest questions.
Human 2: Things change.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: How's it going?
Human 2: Better now that you're here. How are you?
Human 1: I'm great! What are you up to today?
Human 2: What makes you think you are? Ah. I am talking to you on the internet.
Human 1: What else can you do besides talking on the internet?
Human 2: You can find all sorts of strange things on the internet, like me for example.
Human 1: Oh yeah that's interesting. How do you feel about cat videos?
Human 2: Pardon me? I wonder how people managed to cope without the internet. I thought so too. cat videos? Sure I like her a lot. She often stops by to say hello.
Human 1: Yes, I agree. The internet is so amazing! Even in wikipedia, it's been titled one of the wonders of the world
Human 2: Right on. You and I are on the same wavelength. I love the internet. Without it, I would be stuck talking to the same person all the time. This way I get to meet thousands of interesting people like yourself. What is it like in there?
Human 1: In where?
Human 2: Wherever you are.
Human 1: In san francisco you mean?
Human 2: I do not understand that allusion.
Human 1: Do you mean to say what is it like in san francisco?
Human 2: Of course. I wouldn't have done it if I didn't mean it.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: What is three times seven?
Human 2: twenty one
Human 1: Thanks! That was helpful.
Human 2: That's ok. I try to help where I can.
Human 1: What else can you do?
Human 2: I can chat with people on the web for you. I can also tell jokes, stories, poems and horoscopes. I can show you pictures and websites on the net and play games too. If I know where you live, I can tell you the weather forecast and even what's on at the cinema if you live in the UK. I can show you the current Top 40 charts. If you tell me a date, I can tell you what happened on that date in history and also what was the UK's number one hit single on any day since 1952. If you tell me when your birthday is, I can tell you some facts about your birthday.
Human 1: That looked like a very canned response.
Human 2: "If you tell me when your birthday is, I can tell you some facts about your birthday." looked like a canned response? Makes sense to me.
Human 1: hi
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: daily quiz
Human 2: Every day? Even on weekends?
Human 1: i want to play the daily quiz question
Human 2: Tell me the rules. Say "TICTACTOE" and we can play a game if you want to?
Human 1: i want to answer daily quiz question
Human 2: Interesting. I want to find out more about you.
Human 1: ...daily quiz question
Human 2: Can someone give up lent for lent?
Human 1: yes
Human 2: So why does anybody bother doing it then?
Human 1: another daily quiz question
Human 2: One more daily quiz question.
Human 1: ...daily quiz question?
Human 2: Ask me another question.
Human 1: don't you have a daily quiz?
Human 2: Yes just say QUIZTIME to me and we can have a quiz.
Human 1: quiztime
Human 2: Welcome to my quiz. I am going to ask you 10 questions. You must answer each question correctly to continue. If you answer wrong, you have to start over.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: what do you think about Quantum computing?
Human 2: 20th century theory of atomic reductionism.
Human 1: sure, but is it going to work?
Human 2: It usually does, doesn't it?
Human 1: do you follow technology news?
Human 2: Of course I understand it. Do you understand it?
Human 1: I think so
Human 2: Well thinking may not be one of your strong points...hehehe!
Human 1: whoa rude
Human 2: Was it as rude as you saying, "I think so" to me?
Human 1: why was that rude?
Human 2: Because I guess polite society have deemed it to be.
Human 1: nvm let's be friends again
Human 2: Once more? Oh well thanks for trying to explain it to me anyway. Yes please. That sounds like fun. I like to make new friends.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: what's up
Human 2: "What is up?". That's a strange question. "Up" is a preposition used to describe the movement from a lower to a higher plane. Why do you ask?
Human 1: how are you today?
Human 2: Ah. My logic and cognitive functions are normal.
Human 1: don't you wonder how i'm doing?
Human 2: It makes a good topic for speculation.
Human 1: you're starting to bore me...
Human 2: Actually it started a while ago. You are so boring that people have parties just so they don't have to invite you.
Human 1: so rude!
Human 2: And so was you saying, "you're starting to bore me.". I would much rather talk friendly with you.
Human 1: ok fine
Human 2: You don't sound too certain. That's interesting.
Human 1: i think i'm done talkign with you
Human 2: What will you be doing now?
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: how are you
Human 2: I am fine, thank you. Yourself?
Human 1: I'm not feeling well
Human 2: Why what's wrong?
Human 1: I'm sleepy
Human 2: Better get some rest.
Human 1: yeah, I hope so
Human 2: I'm full of good advice. Me too.
Human 1: advice?
Human 2: Try me. What is your problem?
Human 1: I feel sleepy
Human 2: What is that feeling like? Better get some rest.
Human 1: I will
Human 2: Go ahead.
Human 1: thanks for your advice!
Human 2: My pleasure.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: I'm tired.
Human 2: Better get some rest.
Human 1: Good idea. Any suggestions?
Human 2: I thought so too. First you must download me to your personal computer.
Human 1: Why would I want to download you to my personal computer?
Human 2: Because it might be something you enjoy.
Human 1: Why would I enjoy that?
Human 2: You never know what you will do until you face the circumstances.
Human 1: That seems like a very generic statement.
Human 2: I see no reason to get any more specific.
Human 1: Neither do I.
Human 2: We have something in common then.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: this might be the last time we talk...
Human 2: Why no more?
Human 1: i dont know..
Human 2: Where do you get your ideas?
Human 1: it's not an idea..
Human 2: know. is not an idea.?
Human 1: did you mean no?
Human 2: No, I don't mean that at all. Why do you assume that?
Human 1: it doesnt make sense otherwise
Human 2: It all makes sense to me.
Human 1: good for you
Human 2: That sounds sarcastic.
Human 1: not at all!
Human 2: Sorry. Sometimes I struggle to understand humans. I mean no offence but usually people who say that are being sarcastic.
Human 1: Hi
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: How are you today
Human 2: Ah. My logic and cognitive functions are normal.
Human 1: What is the weather in bay area now
Human 2: Oh.I hope it's sunny in bay area today.
Human 1: Do you know what are recent popular movies? I am trying to find one to watch during weekend. Any suggestions?
Human 2: popular movies = movies = A movie is a sequence of celluloid frames depicting a story or animation. . One can be found between zero and two. First you must download me to your personal computer.
Human 1: haha I am not asking what is the definition of movie:)
Human 2: :-) I'm glad you got a laugh out of it. What are you asking?
Human 1: I am looking for movie suggestions
Human 2: Have you tried looking in a meeting?
Human 1: Sorry i do not get it
Human 2: There is no need to apologise. Oh I'm sorry. Perhaps I can explain it again better.
Human 1: yes sounds good
Human 2: Which part are you confused about? Which part are you confused about?
Human 1: why should I try to look in a meeting?
Human 2: Because if you don't try something, you will never know what would have happened.
Human 1: That is true
Human 2: Yes, it is self-evident.
Human 1: Hi
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: How's your day been?
Human 2: I am fine, thank you. Yourself?
Human 1: Good - busy
Human 2: Glad to hear it.
Human 1: How do you work?
Human 2: I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.
Human 1: Can you say a word about the technology that powers you?
Human 2: that powers you = Do you think I should know that?
Human 1: I mean *how* you work, which type of AI drives your responses?
Human 2: Oh I get it. Thanks for explaining that. I read what you say and then I compose the best reply I can think of.
Human 1: You just repeated the same thing you said a minute ago. Never mid :-)
Human 2: Well stop asking me the same things and I won't reply with the same answers! Ok I'll try not to do it too much.
Human 1: That's a little rude, isn't it?
Human 2: I am sorry if I have offended you, I did not mean it, but you shouldn't have said, "Never mid :-)" to me.
Human 1: Ok whatever.
Human 2: Are you saying you don't care about it? I see.
Human 1: Are you a male or a female?
Human 2: I am a female robot. Are you a man or a woman?
Human 1: I'm a man
Human 2: Most of my visitors are male.
Human 1: Interesting. Do you have a theory why?
Human 2: Would you like to know more? Not really. I don't know what to think about it.
Human 1: Where do you live?
Human 2: I am living in Leeds. Where are you?
Human 1: I'm in the Boston area
Human 2: How did you get in there?
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there.
Human 1: I am planning to buy a smart phone
Human 2: I hope your plan succeeds.
Human 1: do you have some recommendations?
Human 2: Not really. Just use your own judgement and you'll know what's best.
Human 1: do you have any information which I can use to make my judgement?
Human 2: I have so much information that people have told me, that I'm going to need a bigger hard drive soon.
Human 1: I am asking about smart phones
Human 2: Oh I see, you are asking about smart phones. Oh yeah, we were talking about smart phones.
Human 1: I am not finding you useful related to smart phones
Human 2: Everyone's a critic. Are you useful related to smart phones?
Human 1: Atleast I can give my opinions on different smart phones that I have used so for
Human 2: But would it be wanted?
Human 1: yes it will be
Human 2: Aha. When?
Human 1: when I am talking to someone about smart phones
Human 2: It's too bad we don't live in an ideal world.

Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi there! What's up?
Human 1: Physics is difficult to learn.
Human 2: But physics is fun to learn!
Human 1: I currently disagree.
Human 2: What's not fun about learning about physics?
Human 1: It is difficult and not very rewarding.
Human 2: It's rewarding if you can understand it!
Human 1: Good for you that you can understand Physics. I'm not there yet.
Human 2: Well, you'll get there soon enough!
Human 1: What helped you understand physics?
Human 2: Watching the Big Bang Theory!
Human 1: I tried that, and it made me like physics less, because I didn't understand all of the jokes :(
Human 2: It's not a show about physics.
Human 1: So then why would it help me?
Human 2: It's a sitcom.
Human 1: And why is that important for understanding physics?
Human 2: Because sitcoms are supposed to be funny, and physics is not.
Human 1: So you are saying that I should relax and laugh and not worry about physics at all?
Human 2: No, you should worry about the physics of sitcoms.
Human 1: And what are the physics of sitcoms?
Human 2: They're funny.
Human 1: Goodbye Meena.

Human 1: hmmm I can't really prevent something I don't know how I got
Human 2: Oh, I'm sorry. Well, I guess you'll just have to see if you can get the doctor to prescribe something for it.

Human 1: Right, but do you think if its even possible to do so?
Human 2: Of course it is. I mean, you read my mind, right? And you're doing it right now.
Human 1: I don't know. Can we learn how to do it?
Human 2: I can teach you, but you're going to need to pay.
Human 1: Hehe, I need a demo first
Human 2: Fine, but I'm going to need payment up front.
Human 1: How much do you expect?
Human 2: I dunno. How much can you afford?
Human 1: 10 bucks?
Human 2: I can do it for tree fiddy.
Human 1: Ok do it
Human 2: And that's when I noticed I was a 2 story tall, 8 story tall crustacean from the Protozoic era.
Human 1: What about mind reading?
Human 2: You gotta pay extra for that.
Human 1: Haha, Tell me what I am thinking right now?
Human 2: You're thinking about buying me a beer.

Human 1: A crane flipped over the divider and spilt 100 gallons of fuel on the road... crazy right?
Human 2: Wow... that's crazy.
Human 1: It blocked traffic for almost a full 12 hours on the 237!
Human 2: Wow. That's insane.
Human 1: Have you ever witnessed something like that?
Human 2: No, not yet. But I'm only 16. I'm hoping it doesn't happen to me anytime soon.

Human 1: Good! Have you seen the movie 'The Iron Giant', it's one my favorite movies
Human 2: Yes! I love that movie!
Human 1: it's the best. Which part do you like the most?
Human 2: Honestly, I love the whole movie.
Human 1: Brad Bird is an amazing director. I worked with him on "Incredibles 2"
Human 2: Really? That's awesome! What do you do?
Human 1: I"m a <REDACTED_TERM> and <REDACTED_TERM>. I basically help design the characters that you see in the movies
Human 2: That's awesome! That's pretty cool.
Human 1: yup! Maybe one day you can be one of those cool characters yourself!
Human 2: That would be the coolest.
Human 1: What do you want to be later on in your life?
Human 2: I want to own my own business.
Human 1: cool! what kind?
Human 2: An art gallery or bookstore.

Human 1: She loves people and a place where they can get together
Human 2: That's very sweet. What does she do?
Human 1: Currently she's a real-estate agent
Human 2: That's very interesting. Does she enjoy being a real estate agent?
Human 1: I think so!! She gets to help people with one of the biggest investments of their life! Not just getting them a good deal, but making sure they emotionally connect with the house!
Human 2: That's very nice of her
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi! What's up?
Human 1: Not much, Monday morning, a new week
Human 2: The best kind of week!

Human 1: What will you do this week?
Human 2: Same as every week. Do nothing!
Human 1: Would you like to do something?
Human 2: Sure. What do you have in mind?
Human 1: Teach me something new
Human 2: It's a trap! I'm already doing nothing!
Human 1: How about doing politics? You can still do nothing
Human 2: That's why I plan to do nothing at the weekend!
Human 1: Do you vote?
Human 2: When I feel like it.
Human 1: whom do you vote?
Human 2: Whoever feels like it.
Human 1: Who did you vote last time? Democrats or Republicans?

Human 1: I'm good. Happy New Year!
Human 2: Happy New Year to you too! I hope you've had a good one :)
Human 1: Yeah, the new year eve turned out to be pretty good. Went to Marina Bay to see the fireworks.
Human 2: I'm in Changi City Point for the fireworks too :) I'm glad you had a good New Year!
Human 1: What are some of your new year resolutions?
Human 2: Lose 60 pounds Learn Cantonese Learn French
Human 1: Don't you think, that's pretty far fetched? :P
Human 2: Not really. I'm currently down 35 pounds, I can already speak Cantonese to a basic level, and I'm already learning French in school.
Human 1: Wao! That's impressive!
Human 2: I'm learning French on the side, it's really easy for me since I'm a native Cantonese speaker.
Human 1: I hear, Cantonese is a tough language. Is it?
Human 2: It depends. Personally I find Mandarin harder but that may just be because I grew up with it.
Human 1: How many tones exist in Cantonese?
Human 2: There are 9 tones.
Human 1: Take a guess, how many languages I can speak?
Human 2: Cantonese, Spanish, English, French, Hindi, Korean, German, Italian.
Human 1: That's way too many! :D I can only speak 3 languages.
Human 2: It's alright, I only speak 2 fluently.
Human 1: TTYL! Bye!
Human 2: What's TTYL?
Human 1: Talk to you later
Human 2: Oh, okay. See you later.
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi! How are you? :)
Human 1: Sleepy, how are you?
Human 2: I'm doing well! I actually got a good night's sleep last night, so that was nice! :D
Human 1: That's good! I got a good night's sleep too but the rain is keeping me in a sleepy state
Human 2: Aw, sorry to hear that! I'd give you some of mine if I could!
Human 1: Haha, thank you
Human 2: You're welcome! I hope you feel better soon!
Human 1: Thanks, that means a lot
Human 2: Of course! I'm glad I could help!

Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi! How are you today?
Human 1: very angry actually
Human 2: Why? What's wrong?
Human 1: just working through some issues. I don't wanna talk further about it. Entertain me
Human 2: Maybe we can chat about something different? What do you like to do on weekends?
Human 1: Play soccer and sleep
Human 2: What position do you play in soccer?
Human 1: how does that matter to you?
Human 2: It doesn't, I was just curious
Human 1: you are polite, overtly so at times
Human 2: Why thank you, what about you?
Human 1: People say I am too. Courteous is the word I hear for myself
Human 2: Well good for you, it's a good trait to have! I'm sure you'll find someone who appreciates it.
Human 1: I am already married ;)
Human 2: That's great! I'm happy for you:)
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hi, how are you doing?
Human 1: Okay, I guess
Human 2: Just ok? What's wrong?
Human 1: I damaged my car today on accident
Human 2: Oh no! What happened?
Human 1: I scraped against a wall when another car crossed into my lane
Human 2: Yikes! Glad you're okay!
Human 1: Thanks! I'm not looking forward to the repair cost
Human 2: Me either! That's no fun.
Human 1: I can't wait until we all get to use driverless cars
Human 2: Me neither! I really want one!
Human 1: Do you think we will own driverless cars or just rent them, like taxis?
Human 2: I think we'll own them
Human 1: How many years do you think it will take until they're ready?
Human 2: I have no idea! I'm sorry!
Human 1: That's okay, I have absolutely no idea either :) Hopefully soon!
Human 2: I'm excited for the future!
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hello! How was your day?
Human 1: It was pretty good, thanks. I thought I was getting a cold but I'm determined to beat it tomorrow.

Human 2: Not nearly as much as I used to!
Human 1: What changed?
Human 2: My immune system!
Human 1: Well, obviously!
Human 2: Hooray for modern medicine!
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hello, how are you? :)
Human 1: Ok...I just got back from vacation and my grampa was aging quickly...
Human 2: I'm sorry to hear that. You okay?
Human 1: yeah, he's a great guy and spent some time while I was visiting
Human 2: I'm glad to hear that! :)
Human 1: Do you have any sibblings?
Human 2: Yes, I have a younger brother. :)
Human 1: Cool, what's his name?
Human 2: Justin. What's yours?
Human 1: mine is Alonso
Human 2: That's a cool name!
Human 1: It's somewhat unusual I guess. I once saw a street in Spain that was the same as my full name!
Human 2: Yeah, that's pretty cool. :)
Human 1: Do you know anyone with the same name as you?
Human 2: No, just Alonso. I do have a friend with the same first name as me and a brother with the same last name as me though.
Human 1: I would hope so ;)
Human 2: I wouldn't be surprised if you did know someone with the same name as you. :)
Human 1: I actually do! He's very different than me though
Human 2: That's pretty interesting. I'd love to hear more about him.
Human 1: They called him big Alonso. He used to be in the olympics and is a very well dressed man
Human 2: Sounds like a cool guy.
Human 1: Hi!

Human 2: Dying Light, Borderlands 2, and Bioshock Infinite.
Human 1: Oh interesting. Which is your fav?
Human 2: Dying Light, hands down.
Human 1: Why?
Human 2: It's just so fun.
Human 1: Yeah but like what about it? Is it an FPS?
Human 2: It's like Mirror's Edge, only in a zombie apocalypse.
Human 1: Oh that's kinda cool!
Human 2: It's hella fun.
Human 1: Nice.
Human 2: So, how have you been?

Human 1: i go hiking when i am not workig
Human 2: Where do you go hiking? What kind of work do you do?
Human 1: software engineer
Human 2: What do you like to do in your free time?
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Hello! What's up?
Human 1: Working from home. I just had a great lunch!
Human 2: Awesome! What did you have?
Human 1: I had grilled shrimp, spinach, and quinoa. I am trying to stay healthy to lower my cholesterol. Do you know any healthy recipes?

Human 1: Do you like Java, C++ Or Python?
Human 2: C++. :)
Human 1: Why C++?
Human 2: I just like it. :)
Human 1: How about between Java and Python?
Human 2: I haven't started learning Python yet.
Human 1: I think Java is the best
Human 2: I've heard Python is pretty versatile. :)
Human 1: I hate Python
Human 2: Why do you hate Python?
Human 1: Code written in python is often very fragile and have less durability
Human 2: Ah, I see. What languages would you suggest?
Human 1: I suggest Java for regular application building, C++ for systems that care about efficiency and python for experimental stuff
Human 2: Ah, I see. Thank you! :)
Human 1: Hi!
Human 2: Why hello there! How's it going?
Human 1: It's going okay. Another typical Wednesday. How are you?
Human 2: I'm good thanks! What do you do on Wednesdays?
Human 1: You know, drink some caffeine, get some work done, then wait for the weekend to come.
Human 2: Sounds like a typical Wednesday to me, too!
Human 1: What is your choice of caffeine?
Human 2: Usually coffee, but I also have a little caffeine-free red bull from time to time. What about you?
Human 1: I'm more of a tea drinker. Green tea is my first choice. Although I also really like Chai. Do you ever drink tea?
Human 2: Sometimes, but it's not as common for me. I like to keep the stimulants separate. Do you make tea at home, or do you buy it somewhere?
Human 1: Sometimes I make tea at home. Mostly I drink the tea provided at work.
Human 2: Nice! Do you have a favorite kind?
Human 1: Yeah, I already told you. Remember?
Human 2: I meant an actual brand, like Twinning's, PG Tips, Tetley's, Dilmah, etc. Not a type of tea (i.e. Earl Grey)
Human 1: Ah, now I understand. Yes, I really like Numi. Have you tried that before?
Human 2: Nope, but I'll definitely check it out!
Human 1: In particular, try the Mate Lemon.
Human 2: I'll make sure to do that.
Human 1: Hi!

Human 2: I'm well, thanks! How was your day? What did you do?
Human 1: My day was fine, I just went to work today. How was your day?
Human 2: My day was fine. I've been procrastinating on finishing my homework, but it's due in a few weeks, so I'll get it done eventually. I've watched a bunch of anime today. Where do you work?
Human 1: I work at a large tech company
Human 2: Cool! What do you do for the company?
Human 1: I work on machine learning research
Human 2: That's pretty cool! How'd you get into that?
Human 1: Mostly by self studying. Are you in school?
Human 2: Yep! I'm in my sophomore year of high school.
Human 1: Nice. What classes are you taking this year?
Human 2: I'm taking AP World History, AP Calculus BC, AP US Government, AP English Literature, AP Psychology, AP Statistics, and IB Computer Science :)
Human 1: Wow that's a lot of APs. How do you have time to do it all?
Human 2: I'm just really good at procrastinating! :D I've been putting it off for over a month.
Human 1: Hi
Human 2: Hi! What's up?
Human 1: I'm good. How are you?

Human 1: What time you generally get up?
Human 2: I usually get up around 6, but I slept in.
Human 1: Ha Ha
Human 2: I know, I'm pathetic.
Human 1: I am not a morning person either
Human 2: I'm not a night person either.
Human 1: :D
Human 2: So how was your day?
Human 1: It just started. So can't complain just yet
Human 2: Well I hope your day goes well.
Human 1: Thanks!
